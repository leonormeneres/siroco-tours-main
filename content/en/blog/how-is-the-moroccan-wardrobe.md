The clothes of a people define a lot about their thinking and their culture in general. The climate, the religion, the form of social thought, are all great influencers of the style of a people. Morocco does not escape this rule.

Of course, Morocco has its peculiarities. When we talk about color, there are basic differences between populations and tribes. For starters, if you see colors on the streets, they are of the Berber people. The Arabs are always more austere and soberer, using mainly black and shades of gray. 

Also, in the desert and in more typical rural parts of Morocco, patterns of colors in scarves or of the djellaba are used to identify the tribe to which a person belongs. Despite these differences so systematized, when you walk the streets of Morocco, the colors are everywhere, especially in the handkerchiefs, and this is always reflecting the sun and the joy of summer. There are lots of shine, lots of embroidery, many embellishments, many earrings and rings on the fingers of Moroccans, finger sandals are also widely used.

Referring to the more traditional and purely Moroccan clothes, directly linked to their culture, we can start with the most extravagant parts. Occasionally, you see the takchita also called kaftan, and it is most often used in celebration.

### · **The tunic called kaftan**

Referring to history, the Kaftans were like robes of members of the judiciary, but then it was an exercise in extending areas and classes of society. Curiously, the story goes that the kaftans used by the Ottoman sultans were decorated with details, which indicated their social class. It originated in ancient Persia that long-sleeved tunic we know today. It persisted, maintaining the Moroccan culture to the present day. 

Nowadays, Kaftan is a type of costume normally worn by Moroccan women during celebrations and important moments such as weddings or major events. Moroccan women simply love this type of dress as it is one of the elegant parts of their culture. But that's not the rule - there are kaftans present as simple pieces of everyday life, but they are also more produced for special events such as weddings and parties. There are even kaftans with embroidered gold. The kaftan models have been adopted and inspire many Haute Couture designers.

In terms of traditional clothing, djellaba is one of the most important pieces of Moroccan clothing.

It is a traditional, large, long-sleeved production that can be worn by both men and women. It can also have a pointed tip, protection from the sun and cold, as well as the strong winds of the desert.

The djellabas were usually made of wool, but nowadays they can also be of cotton, because the choice for lighter fabrics is manifested. There are several styles, depending on the taste of each person. But traditionally, as chosen cores, among tribes, they can indicate marital status, for example. Dark brown, for example, is used by bachelors.
