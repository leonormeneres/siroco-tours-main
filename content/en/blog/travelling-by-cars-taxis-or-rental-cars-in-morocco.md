There are no taxi stops for the petit, so to take one of them you have to stop them by gesturing with your hand when you see them pass by.

**Fares** start at 1.60dh during the day and 2.40dh during the evening/night. The price of petit taxis for a European pocket is very cheap, making it a great option for urban travel.
