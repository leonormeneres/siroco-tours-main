The native currency is Morocco's MAD, or Dh. There are 20's, 50's, 100's and 200's in circulation. Currency exchange to euro is relatively fixed, usually 1 euro = 10.7MAD.

All the cities in Morocco have Banks where you can exchange money. The bank is open from Monday to Friday, excluding holidays. Usually, it's better to change money in the city than at the airport.

## **ATM machines (ATMs)**

Atms can be found in big cities.

• There is a service charge for each withdrawal, usually for each trip abroad. So if you want to minimize the amount you pay, it's best to take more at once.

• Generally speaking, if you use a debit card to withdraw money, you will pay less than if you use a credit card.

• There are different account options at some multi-bank Atms, where you can withdraw funds from "savings account," "credit account," or "default." Use default to withdraw funds from existing accounts in the country of origin.

• In some stores, you can use a credit or debit card to shop large items without paying extra fees.

## **Exchange**

There are many Banks and exchange houses where you can exchange money. Overall, it is a quick and easy operation with a small exchange rate spread. One of the best institutions is probably the foreign trade bank of Morocco (BMCE). Exchanges are located in all cities, airports, seaports and borders. Some hotels offer foreign currency exchange for travelers.

## **The credit card**

Most hotels of a certain scales, as well as some restaurants and shops, accept creditcards (Visa, mastercard, etc.), but generally service station and local small restaurants or stores rarely accept them.

## **Tips**

If you plan to travel alone, you should know that leaving a tip is common in Morocco. Sometimes, if you ask for directions, local young people will show you the way and expect to be paid. If people help you to carry the bags or luggages, they are expecting to be paid too. Usually 10-20 dirhams will do if it is not long distance. Also in restaurants, it's usually 2-5 dirhams for cheap restaurants and 20 dirhams for high-end restaurants.
