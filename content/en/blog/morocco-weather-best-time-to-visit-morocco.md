## What’s Morocco weather like?

![morocco landscape](/uploads/weather_landscape.jpg "morocco landscape")

With a mountain climate in the middle, a desert climate in the south, and also a temperate oceanic climate in the coastal areas that are influenced by the Atlantic and Mediterranean, Morocco has a variety of climate types, generally, in a subtropical region. Morocco is sunny and good for travel all year round. The weather is beautiful and pleasant in spring and autumn (march-may, september-october). In summer (june-august), desert and inland areas are hotter, while coastal cities are more comfortable to spend more time. One can wear loose and breathable clothes, which can not only keep cool but also protect them from the sun. Winter (november-february) is cold in the high atlas mountains, which are covered with snow and suitable for rock climbing and skiing, while the temperature in the south is still mild during the day, but there is a big difference between day and night, so remember to prepare a warm jacket or coat.

## Morocco weather by areas

### _Coastal area_：

![beach](/uploads/beach_morocco.jpg "beach_morocco")

Morocco's narrow northern coast has a temperate Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, and almost sunshine everyday from may to September. Temperatures along the Atlantic coast are cooler throughout the year and winters are mild, such as in [Rabat](/en/destinations/rabat/ "Rabat, the capital of Morocco"), [Casablanca](/en/destinations/casablanca/ "Casablanca"), [Essaouira](/en/destinations/essaouira/ "Essaouira") and other cities.

### _Mountain area_**:**

![mountain](/uploads/weather_moutain.jpg "weather_mountain")

Northwest of Morocco not only has several miles of coastline, but also the rif mountains and the adjacent plateau. Although temperatures are usually as mild as on the northern coast, there is also plenty of rain in winter. In farther inland, the towering Atlas mountains usually experience heavy rains and blizzards in winter, and the snow often lasts until summer.

### _Inland plateau_**:**

![marrakech](/uploads/weather_marrakech.jpg "weather_marrakech")

The valleys under the Atlas mountains, including the area around [Marrakech](/en/destinations/nightlife-in-marrakech/ "Nightlife in Marrakech"), are typically cold in winter and hot in summer. Average winter temperature in Marrakech and the surrounding inland valleys are about 21 degrees Celsius, with peak summer temperature hovering around 38 degrees Celsius.

### _South of Morocco_**:**

![Moonlight in the Sahara](/uploads/Moonlight_in_the_Sahara-1.jpg "Moonlight in the Sahara")

The southern part of Morocco is the Atlantic coast and the Sahara desert. There is almost no precipitation on the northern edge of the Sahara desert. It is very hot and dry in summer and extremely cold in winter, with large temperature difference between day and night, so be sure to keep warm. While where the ocean meets the desert, temperatures are wilder.

## **Best time to visit Morocco**

### _January - February_：

If you like to get away from the crowds, use this time to get a closer look at everyday Moroccan life. This time of year is generally sunny. The climate is mild, and there is still snow on the mountains. Good for a trip to the desert, but keep warm at night.

### _March_：

The beginning of spring, sun is shining, flowers are blossoming, temperatures are usually between 10°C and 20°C, with little rain or snow, but it's best to have all kinds of clothes ready.

### _April – May_:

Temperatures from the high atlas mountains to the desert range from 15°C to 35°C, making it the **most popular Moroccan travel season**. But the weather varies from place to place, especially in spring. During Easter holiday, labor's day, some shops, Banks and local schools may be closed, attractions will be crowded and hotels need to be booked in advance.

#### _Events & Festivals_

![ramadan kid](/uploads/ramadan-kid.jpg "ramadan kid")

[**Ramadan**](/en/blog/travel-in-morocco-during-ramadan/ "Ramadan") (May-July)： According to the islamic calendar, Ramadan lasts for 30 days, depending on the time of year. During the day, when muslims fast, many businesses slow down, shops and restaurants cut back or close, and scenic spots close early. While this may disturb your rhythm, the religious month of Ramadan is also a great experience if you are interested in different [cultures](/en/blog/culture-of-morocco/ "Culture") and religions.

### _July - August:_

It's the hottest months in Morocco, but because of school holiday, so many hotels need to be booked in advance. Daytime temperatures can reach 40°C, so exploration and sightseeing are best done in the morning or evening, better combining outdoor activities with relaxation. This is a great time to visit the **Atlantic coast**, as you may feel colder than other times. Whether you are doing water sports or enjoying delicious seafood, Essaouira is the highlight of summer. The **Atlas mountains** are cooler than the city, but still hot, best for an early morning walk or relaxing by the pool to enjoy a panoramic view of the mountains.

### _September:_

After cooling down from the hot summer months, September is **an ideal time** to visit Morocco, as you can enjoy the pleasant warm weather, soft breeze and clear blue sky as the fall arrives. This is the ideal time to visit the desert.

#### _Events & Festivals_

![street food](/uploads/street_food0.jpg "street food")

**Eid al-adha**"Festival of the Sacrifice" (August-September) : Muslims celebrate the “festival of sacrifice” for three days each year. Throughout the country, families slaughter their livestocks in honor of Islam's prophet Abraham that make it a unique but fun time to visit.

### _October:_

October is **one of the best months** to visit Morocco, for it’s cooler weather that is more comfortable for people to visit. Great for **hiking** in the mountains or visiting the **Atlantic coast**. Travel agencies, hotels, etc., are usually fully booked this month, so trips must be prepared well in advance.

### _November - December:_

The last few months of the year are a good time to explore Morocco's imperial cities. It is sunny but cool, suitable to explore the colorfulness of **Marrakech** and **Fes**. Other regional centers, such as the coastal city of **Essaouira** and the **High atlas mountains**, are also not to be missed, but coastal winds and underlying natural conditions in the mountains can bring colder weather, especially at night. One thing to keep in mind when traveling during the winter months is that not all hotels (especially in northern cities) are equipped with adequate heating, so be sure to bring warm clothing.

#### _Events & Festivals_
