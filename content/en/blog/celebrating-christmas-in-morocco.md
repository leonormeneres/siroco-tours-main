In Morocco, Christmas is not a national holiday, neither in Morocco nor in other **Muslim-majority** African countries, but small communities can do their ceremonies and events to commemorate such an important celebration. With the increase of Western tourism, and the withdrawal of European Christian citizens who choose Morocco as a place of settlement, every year there are more families celebrating Christmas in Moroccan territory. So, if you travel to Morocco in Christmas, it will not be difficult to find a private party for tourists, usually in hotels, as well as small parties in the homes of Christian residents.

## **End of the year and Christmas in Morocco**

A city of great European influence is **Marrakech** , where a large part of the population is foreign, so every year there are more families celebrating Christmas, and even events are created in restaurants and specific shops of Christian customs where travelers can feel a little more closer to home.![Christmas in Morocco medina](/uploads/Christmas10.jpg "Christmas in Morocco medina")

In the larger cities, in those where we find Catholic churches like in Tangier or Casablanca, it is possible to go to some **midnight mass**, or what is the same, the **rooster's mass** with such a tradition in Europe. However, these acts, as we go into the more rural areas, are very difficult to find, because in these places the population is 100% Muslim. Even so, if during this Christmas we travel to Morocco and we are in some of the main cities, we can try to locate one of their churches to know how this date is celebrated here.

It is worth mentioning that Morocco celebrates **New Year’s Day** according to the Islamic calendar. On that day, state institutions and shops do not work, and some locals go high into the mountains to meet the first dawn of the coming year. In general, according to tradition, this day is usually held in the family circle, and no entertainment activities in the country are held.

In Morocco, the traditions of Islam are revered, but at the same time, due to the large number of tourists, the locals willingly welcome our beloved **New Year on December 31st**. On this day the Moroccans also recall the existence of Santa Claus, the New Year's gifts and congratulations. In hotels and nightclubs on a festive night, stars with world names are invited to perform, and an entertainment program is built primarily for Europeans. The cost of New Year's Eve dinner varies depending on the category of the hotel and ranges from 50 to 150 euros. It's nice that the local population always treats tourists with special cordiality, and that is especially important, quite unobtrusively.

Given that these celebrations are usually quite discreet and do not attract too much attention, therefore, we will not find symbols like the typical manger, the Christmas tree or the lights of a thousand colors and garlands hanging from the streets that give so much light and joy to other cities of the world during these days.

Also, you can spend the **New Year's Eve in the desert**. Just get ready for the weather surprises - in the daytime the temperature will not drop below + 20 ºC, but at night the air will cool down to 0ºC. For those who love nightlife and wish to celebrate the New Year are noisy and fun, it is worth to visit one of the many nightclubs of the most modern city of Casablanca. But, in Sahara, it would be a completely different experience.

There was nothing to indicate that it was the end of the year, and there was almost no sign of civilization. What was not lacking was the hospitality because, although for the Moroccans it did not imply end of the year, they made an effort to prepare a much more copious dinner than usual, and even improvised some chimes using a tray of tea and the handle of a knife, accompanying them with some grapes that they had bought expressly.

## **Activities to do**

By the way, the weather in January is not suitable for those who are planning to lie in the sun - the temperature almost never rises above + 23ºC, and the water in the Atlantic Ocean is quite cold. Although winter is an ideal time for **surfing**, as the height of the waves in the ocean reaches its peak. The most popular place for this sport is the resort of Essaouira, this is where most surfers gather. If you consider yourself a fan of high waves, then you can take advantage of the chance and meet the holiday in a circle of like-minded people.

Morocco in winter, although not entirely suitable for beach holidays, but currently of year is particularly good for a variety of excursions. Spend a winter vacation, strolling through the most interesting city of the country Marrakech. Enjoy the advantages of a comfortable temperature by visiting the boundless expanses of the Sahara.

In addition, there are several **ski resorts** in the country. And if you do not represent your New Year's holiday without your favorite white snow and cold, then boldly go skiing on the snow-capped peaks of the Atlas Mountains. Well, national dishes deserve special attention, because what a holiday without a variety of delicacies. Moroccan cuisine is one of the most diverse in the world, it is rich in spices and seasonings, and local desserts can be spoken for hours.

And do not miss the unique and **delicious cuisines**, such as meat dishes from chicken, lamb, camel, which are often seasoned with fresh or dried fruits, creating a completely unique flavor mix. The abundance of spices and fresh herbs is a visiting card of local dishes, which seem to combine incongruous, as indeed in the country itself, where in the strict music of Islam some notes of Christmas and New Year’s celebration sound.
