**Step 1#** Get your belongings ready and mentally prepared. Choose a bathroom and pay usually at the door, usually 10-20 dirhams, or about 50 dirhams if you need a rub. Then you go into a changing room where someone will take care of your clothes. Many bathrooms in Morocco allow you to enter in your underwear. The next step is to enter the steam room and warm up first.

**Step 2#** After you warm up, apply savon beldi all over your body. After a while, a woman comes back to scrub you. She'll scrub you clean from head to toe. Remember to say “bshwiya” to ask her to go easy on you.

**Step 3#** And then you can take a shower by yourself, and the lady will help you too. You can also ask for a massage after a shower.

**Step 4#** Return to the changing room when end. The entire hammam usually takes at least 45 minutes.

**Trust me, it's a great Moroccan cultural experience, and you'll feel like you've never been so clean in your entire life!**
