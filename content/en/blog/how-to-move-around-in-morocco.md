Today the topic will be how to travel around in Morocco, detailing the different means of public transport and the advantages and disadvantages of each one. It can be very useful to know what the recommended transport is depending on the intentions we have.

Let's start then:

## **Getting around Morocco by train is a very economical option**

The train company in Morocco is the ONCF and has a website where prices and schedules are explained.

It is a medium widely used by Moroccans for long distances; it has the disadvantage of being somewhat slow, in addition to which punctual way can be produced inconveniences that delay its exit, but in its favor, It is more convenient than going by bus or taxi, and much cheaper than the latter.

You have two categories, first and second class, with a difference of approximately 30% on the value of the ticket. First class is much more comfortable, not saturated with people and, most importantly, they have assigned seats. This does not happen in second class, so passengers tend to go through a certain stress to get a seat, and thus avoid standing. Moreover, it may be the case that you get up for any reason and when you return you find that your seat has been occupied by another person.

## **Getting around Morocco by bus**

The bus is a transport in Morocco very used by its citizens.

Before we talk about this type of transportation, you must understand that Morocco is a country where as a rule you do not usually have to hurry. Bearing in mind that the coach is the most economical means of transport, it is usually chosen by Moroccans for medium-long distances, and for this reason it is usually "adapted" to their lifestyle.

For example, if you go to a station or visit the CTM website (the most important bus company in Morocco) you will see that they have established schedules, but with the "guidelines" tagline. And that means that it is common to reach a delay of 45 minutes and even an hour.

In addition, we must add that they have the bad habit of spoiling on the road. Anyway, if this happens, do not panic! You will wait for the next bus to do the same thing and put all the people in it.

This transport therefore only is an alternative option for areas where it is difficult to take a taxi, or if you do not want to haggle, since it is an economic transport with a fixed price.

## **The taxi as a means of transport**

[The taxi](/en/blog/travelling-by-cars-taxi-or-rent-cars-in-morocco/ "Travelling by cars: Taxis or rental cars in Morocco") is the ideal transport in Morocco to get around in the city.

Finally, there is the taxi. It is the most used means par excellence, both by tourists and locals, to move around in Morocco.

Taking into account the price of gasoline in Morocco (not too far from Spain), it is surprisingly economical to use this type of transport, but it has its logic: the price is aimed at the Moroccan citizen (with a salary much lower than that of a tourist) since most do not have a car, so they usually use this means of transport to get around.

There are two types of taxis in Morocco: Petit Taxis and Grand Taxis. The Petit taxis are distinguished by their colors, only circulating by city and admitting a maximum of 3 passengers per vehicle. Depending on the city they will be of one color or another, but you will not have problems to differentiate them with Grand Taxis.

#### **To travel in the city petit taxis are recommended**

The maximum you can be charged for this type of taxi is 20 mad, which change is usually less than two euros, but before mounting, asking the taxi driver to avoid misunderstandings.

The Grand Taxis are characterized by being Mercedes 270 in white and are mainly used for cross-city or long-distance journeys. They have a capacity of five passengers (not counting the driver), since they use the passenger seat to get two people.

On the other hand, in the Grand Taxis it is necessary to make an extra effort to get a good price , and for this you have two options: on the one hand, you can try to get more people to share expenses, either by looking for yourselves or by commenting to the taxi driver that you prefer to wait until other clients arrive who wish to do the same journey.

One thing that you should consider, and that will help you save something more, is to think carefully about the stop where you started, since depending on where it is located, taxi drivers go in one direction or another. And if you do not have it clear, you can ask an acquaintance or the receptionist where you are staying to recommend.

Having tried all the options, without a doubt the taxi as the ideal solution to move around Morocco, although most of the time it is necessary to haggle before riding. And for long trips the train as a cheaper alternative (bearing in mind that delays may occur), leaving the bus as the last option in case everything else fails.
