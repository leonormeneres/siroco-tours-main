Trade is one of the major attractions of Morocco, because Morocco has a wide variety of products and rich local arts and crafts, these colorful decorative items are not often seen in your country, at least the price is certainly not the same. Carpets, leather lamps, and wool sweaters are just a few of the products on the Moroccan market. Thanks to its rich culture, Morocco boasts a variety of beautiful and unique handicrafts, from which much of its economic growth has come.

Morocco has many cooperatives of artisans, often as small shops and workshops. Usually the charm of a place not only lies in its importance but also simplicity. In Morocco, you can explore souks(Moroccan market), which has a variety of silver jewelry (earrings, bracelets, necklaces, etc.) and Moroccan designs, antiques, as well as a variety of rare and exotic products. Simply walking through the market and seeing the myriad colors and products is a wonderful sensory experience.

If you show interest in a product, you may not get it at the price you want, so it's important to learn how to bargain in Morocco.

As for prices, vendors often use "it's handmade" as part of their trading strategy. You can wander between items you're not so interested in, feel the touch of the product, and let the vendor know that you know all about it.

Usually moroccans exaggerate, for example by saying that some jewellery that is silver but actually not, and that some carpets are made of camel hair (there are no camel hair carpets).

But haggling in Morocco has become a tourist activity and can be fun.

## **Moroccan shopping technique -- bargaining**

Bargaining in Morocco is a fun game. You need intelligence, humor, courage and patience. Wherever you go, you need to discuss the price, and for small items that cost only 20 euros, you may need more than 10 or 20 minutes to bargain.

• Check product quality. Understand how to view product quality.

• Avoid buying through intermediaries. There are a lot of people who will offer to go with you to shopping or take you to the store. Don't accept such services because their purpose is to sell items from the store and receive a commission.

• Often the vendor's first offer is three times what the item is actually worth, but the difference can be much larger.

• Be kind and smile.

• Don't make too many gestures. Verbal communication with both hands should be avoided for cultural reasons.

• Don't spend too much time. Keep in mind that sellers don't spend much of their time if there is hope and benefit.

• Don't go back on your word after you've reached an agreement. It will be very offensive to the business.

• If you don't want to haggle, go to a local production cooperative and warehouse with a "uniform price." Usually you will not be cheated, but the price is also tourist. You can get better prices in ordinary shops.

In Morocco, you can buy some protected species, but it's illegal. Don't buy lizards, turtles, and other animals that have little chance of surviving outside their natural habitat, which will gradually destroy the species.
