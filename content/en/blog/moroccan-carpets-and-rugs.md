The fabrication of carpets one of the most important [craft activities](/en/blog/crafts-of-morocco/ "Crafts of Morocco") in the country, being woven mainly by rural women, [Berbers](/en/blog/what-do-you-know-about-the-berber-people/ "What do you know about the Berber people?") of the mountains. The [culture](/en/blog/culture-of-morocco/ "Culture") of the carpet is deeply rooted in Morocco along with its value, which does not pass with time and because it is a very used element to cover the floor of homes.

Most of them are made with wool from lambs less than one year old. The wool is spun by hand, tied with knots and produced in small cooperatives and factories. They are also made in cotton, silk and synthetic fibers.

There are woven carpets (kilims) in framework or knots. These are more expensive, because they require more time and raw material. The most sought after are the 'abrass', with threads of the same color but in different shades. The most exceptional are those that are made without a pattern, with asymmetric drawings.

The [tradition](/en/blog/customs-and-traditions-of-morocco/ "Morocco traditions and customs") is being lost, being unprofitable for the high cost of wool (10 kg, for a normal carpet) and for the time to elaborate, about two months of work.

They are made of thick wool or silk, following a characteristic pattern of each region.

They are extremely versatile: they can be hung on the wall, to give the home an oriental feel, it can be used to cover the bed, the floor or a table, or used as a picnic blanket.

The drawing is usually geometric, only limited by the technique of weaving, creating an impression of space and movement, but sometimes from details and knotted hair, the colors that mimic the landscape vary from ocher to red.

One of the largest distribution centers is in the village of Tazenakht, high Atlas, Ouarzazate region.

There is an economic variety made of esparto or wool of cactus, typical of the arid zones.

The urban carpets, more elaborate and expensive, are manufactured in the big cities, [Rabat](/en/destinations/rabat/ "Rabat, the capital of Morocco"), [Casablanca](/en/destinations/casablanca/ "Casablanca"), Mediouna, [Tangier](/en/destinations/tangier/ "Tangier") etc. Turkish influence, usually velvet, satin, fine texture are characterized by the central medallion rhombic or hexagonal, the qubba that highlights on a red background planted for various reasons, as well as a wide frame of between three and seven strips decorated with geometric or zoon orphic floral elements of Turkish inspiration.

The blanket of the traditional Moroccan wedding, or handira, is a beautiful piece of textile, hand-woven with sheep's wool and adorned with sequins, this blanket is used in weddings, are typical of the Zemmour region.

In recent years there are proliferating carpets made with the remains of fabrics. These rag rugs, called Boucharuite and in Spain Jarapas, do not follow a traditional stylist pattern, being attributed to the city of Boujad. At first they had no commercial intention, today all Morocco is made in a very similar way.
