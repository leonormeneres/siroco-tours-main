Handicrafts are an important industry in the country and there are shops in almost all cities and rural areas. In fact, there is a network of artisanal centers known as "ensemble artisanal" in the main tourist cities, where it is possible to see the artisans in action. They are also typical ceramic trays on the roads and tourist center.

At present we are witnessing the development of a renewed Moroccan handicraft, union between tradition and modern designs, original productions of great quality and contemporary style.

One of the great motivations of the tourist in Morocco are the purchases of crafts. The variety and beauty of the products is enormous.

### **∙ Carpets**

![Moroccan carpet](/uploads/crafts5.jpg "Moroccan carpet")

In Morocco, you will find two main types of carpets: the urban carpet and the Berber rug. Urban carpets, traditionally made in the [Rabat](/en/destinations/rabat/ "Rabat, the capital of Morocco") capital and surrounding areas, are probably the Moroccan carpets most people imagine. They are thickly woven and intricately laced, usually decorated with geometric patterns. The best cities to buy urban carpets are [Rabat](/en/destinations/rabat/ "Rabat, the capital of Morocco") and [Fez](/en/destinations/fez/ "Fez"), and if you don't want to experience the pleasure of bargaining, you can buy them in government-sponsored stores where prices are uniform.

Berber carpets are made in the countryside by [local Berber in Morocco](/en/blog/what-do-you-know-about-the-berber-people/ "What do you know about the Berber people? "). Each tribe and region has its own style, traditionally, making carpets is a woman's job. Since these carpets tend to be thinner than urban carpets, they are usually hung on the wall as tapestries. Berber carpets are all over Morocco. One of the best places to buy them is in the women's cooperatives, where the larger portion of the profits are directly given to workers.

### **∙ Textile Crafts**
