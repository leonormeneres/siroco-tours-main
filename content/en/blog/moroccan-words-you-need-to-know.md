If you are going to visit Morocco, you are probably also looking to learn more about this place. [Culture](/en/blog/culture-of-morocco/ "Culture of Morocco"), the way of thinking socially and all the characteristics that a people translate are intrinsic in their speech, in their terms. Because of this, it is interesting to know some key points before enjoying the trip. Here are some words you need to know.

## **What is Medina?**

![Typically medina of Morocco](/uploads/1-3.jpeg "Typically medina of Morocco")

This is probably one of the most common terms you will hear when we talk about Morocco. [Casablanca](/en/destinations/casablanca/ "Casablanca"), [Chefchaouen](/en/destinations/chefchaouen/ "hefchaouen, a jewel in the Rif aloof from the world"), [Tetouan](/en/destinations/enjoy-your-visit-to-tetouan/ "Enjoy your visit to Tetouan"), [Tangier](/en/destinations/tangier/ "Tangier"), [Fez](/en/destinations/fez/ "Fez"), [Meknes](/en/destinations/meknes/ "Meknes"), [Marrakech](/en/destinations/nightlife-in-marrakech/ "Nightlife in Marrakech"), [Rabat](/en/destinations/rabat/ "Rabat, the capital of Morocco"), Sale, and [Essaouira](/en/destinations/essaouira/ "Essaouira"), all these Moroccan cities have one thing in common: their medina. This is the place to go when visiting a Moroccan city.

A medina refers to the old part of a city as opposed to modern European-style neighborhoods. The ramparts are, originally, there to protect the city from the invaders. Generally, a large part of a medina is occupied by the souks.

![Souks with many shops](/uploads/marrakesh-657158_1280-1.jpg "Souks with many shops")

[Fez](/en/destinations/fez/ "Fez"), the second largest city in Morocco after Casablanca, has, in its heart, the oldest and largest medina in the world. This model example of an Eastern city is placed under the protection of UNESCO, and it is unchanged since the twelfth century. The deep blue of its ceramics is one of the symbols of Fes.

The medina of [Marrakech](/en/destinations/nightlife-in-marrakech/ "Nightlife in Marrakech") is also one of the largest medinas of Morocco and the most populated of North Africa. Its refinement and urban specificity derive directly from the total virginity of the land on which it was erected in the 11th century.

## **What is a Riad?**

![A sweet riad with a dooryard](/uploads/photo-1540396515873-dd778f7679e7.jpeg "A sweet riad with a dooryard")

The term Riad is often used improperly to designate a villa or a Moroccan house. Yet the word Riad has a very specific meaning.

A Riad is a traditional Moroccan house: a town house, entirely turned inwards, closed on the outside, surrounded by high walls, with a minimum of openings, to protect from the heat and noise of the street. The riads are most often located in the Medina, in the heart of the old city.

They are organized around a patio that plays the role of a central living room. The [architecture](/en/blog/moroccan-architecture/ " Moroccan Architecture") of the house is all built around this open space, shaped well, around which unfolds the floors. The windows open onto the patio and the rooms are often served by passageways and balconies.

The patio is naturally fresh. It is usually planted with greenery and has a pond that allows you to cool off.

![A beautiful terrance in the middle of medina](/uploads/marrakech-1504711_1280-1.jpg "A beautiful terrance in the middle of medina")

The lounges and the dining room are open on the patio and allow to enjoy its freshness. The kitchen is on the ground floor. The rooms are upstairs. The roof is converted into a terrace and solarium and generally offers a panoramic view of the city.

Thus, at the bend of the narrow streets of the old town, the amazed visitors discover real jewels of architecture and [crafts](/en/blog/crafts-of-morocco/ "Crafts of Morocco"), protected and comfortable places, havens of peace and tranquility.

## **What is a Tajine?**

![Tajine with vegetables](/uploads/chicken-3447092_1920-1.jpg "Tajine with vegetables")

The term [tajine](/en/blog/how-to-make-tajine/ "How to make Tajine ") (tagine) can be used for a special-shaped pot or jar that is native to North Africa, and for a cooked dish that is cooked in this pot.

A tajine jar is usually made of clay and has a domed lid. A tagine pot is usually made of clay and a terracotta shade, although some tajines are decorated with colorful glazes and intricate designs. Usually, these two-part pots: a shallow, round or square and a dome base or funnel-shaped lid. When cooking, this unusually shaped lid collects released steam which then trickles back into the stew, preventing the ingredients from dehydrating. The top of this cover often ends in a "button" of clay that stays cool during cooking, to remove the lid without burning your fingers. After a tajine is cooked, the lid is removed, and the dish is passed directly from the base of the pot.

![Tagine with chicken and fruits](/uploads/30114387166_e7fa7862b0_b-1.jpg "Tagine with chicken and fruits")

The dish known as [tagine](/en/blog/how-to-make-tajine/ "Tajine") is usually meat slowly cooked, stewed, over low heat with vegetables, fruits, nuts, and a mix of a lot of spices, in addition to the broth. These ingredients are boiled for several hours over a low heat. Usually, this long cooking time can make the meat become very tender. The meats that are found in tagines are lamb and chicken, although many types of meat and fish can be prepared this way.

While tajines are generally associated with countries like Morocco and Algeria, they have been around since the late 20th century and have found some popularity in Western countries. North African restaurants can be found in many major cities in countries like the United States, England and France, and tagine jars can be purchased at many gourmet cookware stores in the whole world.(Check also [Couscous](/en/blog/couscous/ "Couscous"), [Typical sweets of Morocco](/en/blog/typical-sweets-of-morocco/ " Typical sweets of Morocco"))

## **Ksars and Kasbahs – old Castles and villages**

![Ksars and Kasbahs](/uploads/kasbah_telouet5.jpg "Ksars and Kasbahs")

The word " kasbah " or " casbah " has a very broad meaning. In each country, and even in each region, it is applied to a different construction: from an isolated fort in the middle of the countryside to a district of the city within which the state administrations and army.

In southeastern Morocco, however, Kasbah is generally referred to as a square-plan building with four corner towers, built of mud and usually used to house a family of notable people. This type of habitat is of Berber origin and in this language it is called Tighremt. The word kasbah is recent and was introduced upon arrival in the region around the 1920s by Arab and French citizens.

The oldest kasbahs date back to the 18th century, perhaps to the 17th century, but most of them do not exceed a hundred years, because before that the population of the pre-Saharan valleys lived in the ksour. (Check also [Aït-Ben-Haddou](/en/destinations/ait-ben-haddou/ "Aït-Ben-Haddou"))

![A ksar in middle atlas mountain](/uploads/photo-1534003085889-5e1870403fdc.jpeg "A ksar in middle atlas mountain")

A ksar (ksour plural) is a village surrounded by a wall and protected by watchtowers, which includes inside dozens or even hundreds of houses, not counting the mosque, the streets, collective facilities and a place where the parties were held. All ksour have one or more monumental entrances, sometimes decorated with finesse.

The ksour are in principle much older than the kasbahs, some are even millennia, but there are also some that were built in the 19th century by previously [nomadic tribes](/en/blog/nomads-in-morocco/ "Nomads in Morocco"). Sometimes we find one or more kasbahs inside a ksar. The ksour are much more numerous in the eastern valleys, while the kasbahs dominate the western zone.

In addition to kasbahs and ksour, there are also other traditional mud-brick buildings in this region: the marabouts or mausoleums that cover the tomb of a saint; the communal attics, which look like a kasbah seen from the outside, and the towers isolated lookouts. In the tourism sector, we often gather but wrongly all these different constructions under the generic term "kasbahs". Some hotels and restaurants are even now adding the word "kasbah" to their name to attract customers, while in most cases it is a newly constructed block of reinforced concrete. Because of this, the word "kasbah" is losing its original meaning and it could be that in a short time it simply becomes synonymous with "hotel".

## **Camels or Dormedaries**

![Camel with two humps](/uploads/camel-4319_1280-1.jpg "Camel with two humps")

Do you always confuse camels with dromedaries? It's very easy to distinguish these "desert horses." Pay attention.

There are two types: the Bactrian camel and the Camelus Dromedarius (Arabian Camel), which have at least a visible physical appearance that shows that they are different: the number of humps. The camel has two humps and a dromedary has only one. Camels have been extinct in their wild state, finding just some in the arid areas of Australia. However, camels in Morocco are domesticated. Still, the dromedary is also a camel. Are you still confused? It is that the animal belongs to the class of the camelids and its scientific name is Camelus dromedarius.

Contrary to the general belief, the humps do not accumulate the water that the animal ingests. They are fat reserved that give them energy and strength when they spend a lot of time without eating food. It is also a defense of the body to protect itself from heat by making trips in very hot areas. The fat is so concentrated in one area, that it is used more easily to give energy to the body of the animal. When the animal is well fed, the hump is stiffer and higher.

Obviously, efficient water retention is also a factor for these animals to withstand long excursions in warm places, with little liquid ingestion. Camels can drink up to 200 liters at once!

![Camels with only one hump](/uploads/dromedary-4118312_1280-1.jpg "Camels with only one hump")

Camels from the Middle East and North Africa, which are used as a means of transportation, use a saddle made especially for the back, called Rahla. The bodies of these animals are completely adapted to the climates and sandy and desert regions. The fur protects them from the cold, falling in the summer to give them more freshness. The legs are wider when they touch the ground so as not to sink into the sand. And they can close their eyelids and nostrils to prevent the entry of sand during a storm.

These animals have an incredible sense of orientation. They can detect water in the distance – almost 50 miles away – and many times they can save people who are lost in the desert, after a sandstorm.

The life expectancy of a camel is 40 to 50 years. Some say the dromedary is more docile, others say the Bactrian camel is quieter. However, it is known that when the camel gets annoyed with something, it can spit anyone in the face. And they have good aim, so be careful!

## **The adobe**

![Smooth black wall](/uploads/photo-1527780910201-bbc3c4673df5.jpeg "Smooth black wall")

Adobe is one of the oldest and most popular construction techniques in the world. Its use has been recorded more than 10 thousand years in the most varied areas and climates of the planet.

Hassan Fathy (1899 - 1989) was a remarkable Egyptian architect pioneer in the use of this technology, which is still considered appropriate in Egypt today.

There are many examples of adobe and adobe brick constructions in various parts of the world that have appeared throughout history. In North Africa, notable for its beauty, are the kasbahs that are built in adobe in Morocco. Many of these kasbahs are still well preserved nowadays - and the uses of raw earth is a construction technique that belongs to ancient local traditions from all over the world where it is still used today.
