Morocco is a diverse mosaic of peoples and cultures because of its history. This led Morocco to bring to Berber support both the Saharan and Sub-Saharan African rhythm, the Greco-Roman, Phoenician and African rituals, the Arab culture without omitting the Andalusian refinement.

The history of Morocco is truly incredible. The country's strategic position, between Africa and Europe with the Mediterranean's control over it, has stirred up a lot of lust and attracted many civilizations.

But every civilization, each dynasty leaves traces, often in the form of monuments. If these monuments are sometimes destroyed, feeding the museums into vestiges, some pass through the epochs and constitute the cultural heritage of a country. In this respect, Morocco is very rich, especially since Moroccan handicrafts are remarkable, taking advantage of Roman, Berber, Arab, Andalusian and Jewish influences.

As you can see, Moroccan museums do not miss their favorite raw materials: art, crafts, culture and traditions.

Most Moroccan cities have a museum. Each region is proud of its peculiarities. The traditional objects and the most beautiful pieces of the handicrafts of the region are often highlighted and preserved in these places, like the ethnographic museum Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah in Essaouira, the Museum of Oudayas in Rabat or the museum Dar Si Saïd in Marrakech. There are also museums dedicated to contemporary art, such as Tangiers in the former British consulate, and ceramics in Safi, whose national museum is housed in an old citadel built by the Portuguese.

Other museums present the Moroccan culture without focusing on a particular region. One could mention the archaeological Museum of Rabat.

Morocco's most beautiful and interesting museums are certainly the Dar Batha Museum of Fes which exhibits the arts and traditions of the Fassie region and the Marrakech Museum which shines with its dynamism and exhibits contemporary works alongside traditional artifacts from all over the country.
