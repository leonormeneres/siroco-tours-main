Although you may already imagine that Morocco charmed and continues to enchant many hearts, you probably did not know this interesting fact: the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was one of those.

Winston Churchill believed and said openly that "Marrakesh is simply the best place in the world to spend an afternoon." Which explains why, even with its wartime agenda, it has not kept away from experiencing the charms of the inspiring city of Morocco. On one of his most memorable afternoons, during a prime-time World War II scenario, he took time out of meeting with US President Franklin D Roosevelt to visit his beloved retreat in the old imperial city and show it to his friend.

It is quoted that Churchill decidedly told Roosevelt "You cannot go to North Africa without seeing Marrakesh." The politician wanted to return immediately to the United States to concentrate on war plans. "Let's spend two days there," he persisted. Churchill: "I must be with you when you see the sun in the Atlas Mountains."

On January 23, 1943, the two war leaders left [Casablanca](/en/destinations/casablanca/ "Casablanca") for the journey hours to Marrakesh, taking stops for a picnic. The village in which they stopped after this, located five minutes’ walk from the [Majorelle Garden](/en/destinations/the-beauty-of-the-majorelle-garden/ "Majorelle Garden"), the popular tourist attraction created by the French designer Yves Saint Laurent, has its own tower, from where Churchill liked to paint the spectacular sunset for which the city ​​is famous. Churchill was a gifted artist who came back many times to Marrakech to paint the landscape that has captivated so many.

Upon arrival, Churchill wanted Roosevelt to accompany him to the top of the tower to see the panoramic view of Marrakesh, and to witness for himself that magical and beloved moment during a Moroccan sunset - the lights and colors framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Atlas Mountains. Care was taken to take Roosevelt in a wheelchair, down the winding stairs to the roof of the tower to watch the spectacle.

According to Celia Sandys, Churchill's granddaughter, Roosevelt was clearly taken by the moment. Leaning on a couch, Roosevelt said to Churchill, "I feel like a sultan." At that moment, Churchill himself murmured, "It's the most beautiful place in the world. "

### **The context**

During the 1940's Morocco was under control of France, and from 1940-1944 the Vichy government aligned with Nazi Germany. The government did everything in its power and scope to protect all the citizens of Morocco. Especially at this point, since Morocco had more Jewish citizens than any other Muslim-majority country, totaling more than 300,000. The Nazi government demanded of the Sultan a list of all the Jews in the country, and his reply was: "We have no Jews in Morocco, only Moroccan citizens."

At this point, measures passed that restricted Jewish citizens and deported some to labor camps located in the Sahara Desert. All Moroccans were somehow mitigated during this period, suffered greatly and became second-class citizens, even in their own country.

Finally, in 1942, American and British forces were preparing to launch the North African campaign. His first foray into the region was called Operation Torch. This was also the debut battle of the Americans in World War II. The plan was to land forces in Morocco via Casablanca and Algeria to cut off the Germans. After eliminating the Germans from North Africa, it would open the Mediterranean and the possibility of remaining without having to worry about the German forces for the next months.

We can say that the Americans and British won, giving Germany its first defeat in World War II. This victory also opened Morocco, creating the atmosphere by which it was best known during World War II.

In 1943, the Casablanca Conference brought together allied leaders to come up with strategies for the coming battles. Before the conference, there was a reception for Churchill and Roosevelt, who went to Casablanca to meet themselves. It is said that the information on this meeting reached Hitler, but due to a translation problem he assumed that the meeting had taken place in the White House - Casablanca translated from Spanish is equivalent to the White House.

Finally, after completing the diplomatic mission and initiating a process of appreciation, Churchill wanted to show Roosevelt the beauty of the Atlas Mountains and the famous visit to the legendary Mamounia Hotel in Marrakech.

It was during the afternoon of the next day that Churchill painted what would be his only painting during the war. A view of the Atlas Mountains.

### **La Mamounia**

For the rest of his life, Churchill often made winter breaks in Marrakesh. After the war, it was always in La Mamounia. This was partly since, after the war, the owners of Villa Taylor, where he was going to paint, dismissed the property.

The history of La Mamounia, a former royal palace converted into a luxury guesthouse by French settlers in 1923, is as fascinating as the hotel itself. The address was named after the centennial gardens of the rich estate, a wedding gift to Prince Moulay Mamoun of his father, Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Abdellah, in the 18th century.

Its gardens contain a great variety of flowers, olive trees and orange trees. Designed by the architects Prost and Marchisio, in its first decades of existence La Mamounia served as the second home for expatriates, settlers and adventurers, who gathered around whiskey glasses in their bars and gardens.

The then prime minister called him "the loveliest place in the whole world." Churchill's admiration for the hotel swept the planet, attracting the curiosity of other heads of state and crowned heads for decades.

Anyway, Churchill was not the only one. They say that it was within these limits that the band Crosby, Stills & Nash wrote the lyrics of "Marrakesh express" in the late 1960s. When he participated in the jury of the 2004 film festival, Brazilian writer Paulo Coelho wrote in the book of gold: "it was a week of discoveries". All of which are housed in La Mamounia, the luxurious hotel that enchants.
