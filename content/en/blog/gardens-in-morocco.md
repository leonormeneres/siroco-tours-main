The gardens in Morocco have always been a special attitude, as, indeed, in all Muslim countries, they are perceived here as an earthly version of the paradise described in the Koran. It is a place of rest and reflection, an encounter of the eternal and the momentary, a place where mortals cognize the divine.

In Morocco, and especially in Marrakech, standing on the border of the desert and agricultural lands, the appearance of Moorish gardens looks quite natural. It is a garden in which orange trees and flowers usually grow, and there must be a central pond. All this in combination creates a calm, pleasant, shady, beautiful place where the bubbling of water in the fountain makes the atmosphere even more peaceful and attractive.

## Marrakech

In Marrakech and on the northern slopes of the Atlas Mountains, there are many very diverse but invariably wonderful gardens, many of which are open to free access.

### **Gardens of Agdal**

![Gardens of Agdal](/uploads/1600px-Agdale_Fotor.jpg "Gardens of Agdal")

Behind the Royal Palace of Marrakech, 4 kilometers long and 1.5 meters wide stretch the delightful gardens of Agdal. The name "Agdal" originated from the ancient Berber language and is translated as "Meadow behind the Wall".

This is one of the oldest gardens on the planet, it was created in 1157th year by the order of Sultan Abd Al-Mumin. Irrigation is carried out through a complex system of underground pools, in which copper pipes supply water directly from the high Atlas Mountains. The gardens of Agdal are surrounded by adobe walls, the age of which exceeds 600 years.

Today the gardens of Agdal are still the possessions of the king. The entrance is open only on Fridays and Sundays for a limited time. Here you can sit in the shade directly opposite the royal residence.

### **Majorelle Garden**

Imbued with poetry, the majorelle annually attracts many tourists to its tracks. The house is painted in a strictly blue color, which is extremely advantageous against the background of ordinary-looking adobe walls.

This garden was the studio of the artist Jacques Majorelle, who moved to live in Morocco in 1919, in order to continue his career and cure tuberculosis. Majorelle, like Claude Monet, was fascinated by the collection of plants. From his trips he brought North American and Mexican cacti, Asian lotuses, unusual plants from South Africa.

After his death in 1962, the garden was abandoned for some time, and the house was demolished. But the famous French couturier Yves Saint Laurent and his friend Pierre Berger bought the garden territory in 1980 and took care of its restoration and maintenance.

Today, the Majorelle Garden is open for tourists. At the entrance you meet a magnificent fountain and a small bamboo alley with benches. After the 40-degree heat of Marrakech, you can find yourself in a quiet shady garden where birds sing, and colors and colors delight the eyes.

### **Menara Gardens**

![Menara garden in Marrakech](/uploads/Menara_Garden_(Marrakech,_Moroc)_09.jpg "Menara garden in Marrakech")

To the west of Marrakech and very close to the Atlas Mountain we find these emblematic gardens, inside which are concentrated orchards and fields of olive trees. It is a wonderful place to relax for a tired traveler, one of the most romantic parks in Morocco. It is also a popular place among locals for picnics.

The park covers an area of ​​one hundred hectares and is surrounded by a wall. In the middle of the park there is an artificial lake, to which a system of underground pipes running from the Atlas Mountains and feeding the lake with water is brought. In the second half of the XIX century near the pool was built a small pavilion, with a balcony which offers a beautiful view of its central alley, the minaret of the mosque and the mountain peaks.

The history of the Menara Gardens is surrounded by many legends. In one of them it is said that the founder of the gardens of Sultan Abd al-Mumin nightly brought a new beauty. After a night of love, she disappeared in one of the innumerable pools, which were subsequently destroyed. Until now, in the gardens find female skeletons. Another says that on the territory of the Menara Gardens, the Almohad dynasty's treasures, selected from the conquered states, are kept.

### **Aromatic Gardens**

Medicinal herbs and spices continue to be very important in the healthcare of Morocco. Also, their role in the relatively recent spa industry is increasing. Local connoisseurs of herbs and healers traditionally collected wild medicinal plants and their seeds in the Atlas Mountains and sold them at the market in Marrakech. Many herbs are grown today in the gardens of the market itself, such as, in the Bioaromatic gardens of Ourika. Slightly higher on the slopes of the Atlas Mountains, deep into the Ourika Valley, a few kilometers from Marrakech are the Nectarome Gardens (www.nectarome.com), where various aromatic and medicinal plants are grown, as well as plants used for the manufacture of essential oils.

### **The Andalusian Garden**

Behind the high walls of ocher color, which on the inside are covered with bougainvilleas, you will see a real green oasis of life. These are palm trees, cypresses, orange and lemon trees, laurels, jasmine, and all kinds of flowers that are only found on the territory of the Maghreb. Such a variety is best served by the Mediterranean climate of Rabat. The whole area of ​​the garden is decorated in the form of different levels of terraces, descending to the river.

Initially, the garden was founded as a gardening experiment for the National University of Agronomic Research, today it is a traditional place of rest for both local population and visiting tourists.

Even though the Andalusian garden was built in the XX century, it gives the impression of a rather ancient structure. This landmark is listed in UNESCO as one of the most valuable botanical gardens in the world. It is interesting that many animals live here, including storks, and cats. There is always a calm, pacifying atmosphere, which contrasts sharply with the busy center of the modern city. It is an ideal place to sit in silence, meditate, thinking about the eternal and relaxing from the city's bustle of everyday life.

### **Exotic Gardens of Rabat**

In 1951, Marcel François, a French horticultural engineer, acquired four and a half hectares of land in Bouknadel on the road to Kenitra. He began to make an exotic garden that opens to the public after 10 years of development. There are plants from China, South Asia, Congo, Japan, Brazil and Polynesia.

Hailed for their beauty and diversity, the Exotic Gardens, beyond their plantations and their varied paths, surprise the visitors with the creativity and the plasticity of the compositions; the meticulous perfection and the spirit of rigor of their facilities and the realism of the atmospheres evoked everything with infinite possibilities of interpretation.

Among other wonderful features, this garden is relaxing: when the sun is at its zenith, the locals come alone or with family to walk in the shade, lie on the lawns, take a mint tea at the bar, sit on these famous benches in the characteristic and exquisitely retro forms of the 1930s, or sneaking under the famous tunnel formed by the pines of the canaries.
