## **Morocco’s Geography and Topography**

![morocco buildings](/uploads/afmar.jpg "morocco buildings")

Morocco, the kingdom of Morocco, is located in north Africa, the northwest corner of the African continent. It borders Algeria to the east, Spain just across the strait of Gibraltar to the north, the vast Atlantic ocean to the west, and the Sahara desert to the south, the largest desert in the world. Due to its special geographical location and historical reasons, the integration of various ethnic cultures has created a unique Moroccan culture.

For those who are new to Morocco and don't know where to start, think of Morocco as a three-layer cake.

The base of the cake is a vast expanse of Sahara desert, nomadic culture, oasis and its magnificent dunes;

The second layer is the ocean, with its long northern and western coastlines nourished by the Atlantic and Mediterranean seas, and its pleasant, laid-back lifestyle;

At the top is the atlas mountains, the "peak of north Africa" that runs through Morocco. Morocco is far more than that, of course, vast farmland, vast forests, north of grazing greenland, ancient and enthusiasm of the medina, unique Arab culture, special hiking or riding trip, exquisite crafts, delicious food, friendly and hospitable moroccans, etc.

All of them make it worthy of the reputation of "North African Garden".

RAM provides services in Morocco to Tangier, Oujda, Fes, El Jadida, Marrakech, Essaouira, Agadir, and Dakhla.
