On any trip, the choice of clothes is quite important. While we think of our comfort, we also value aesthetics, style, objectivity, ease, utility and countless other aspects that are decisive for all the smooth operation of the trip - we do not want to get cold, or too hot. We do not want to walk without a sneaker, or swim without our bikini. What we carry in the suitcase will accompany us all the way, and must be the ideal that suits our planning. In addition, there is always local culture and customs of our destination, which, of course, we want to respect while maintaining our own tastes.

### **How to dress in Morocco despite the heat**

![Moroccan people wear](/uploads/1582210415629.jpg "Moroccan people wear")

Morocco is a place of climate and interesting seasons. The temperature changes are 47º to 12ºC, and you certainly need to think about it to plan what to wear. Anyway, Morocco is hot specially in summer. We already had highs of 46 Celsius in Marrakech. During the rest of the year, it is relatively mild. We have a very different range of temperature among different regions, and it is normal to have large amounts of snow in many mountains from November to April.

This, therefore, is always the cruelest doubt. How do you feel comfortable with this climate while adhering to local customs? First, keep yourself hydrated and do not forget your sunglasses - the first tip is ideal in any country and at any time of the year. Secondly, with elegant dresses and long tops, it is possible to cover up, feel good and still look beautiful for the photos of your vacation. Thirdly, remember that Moroccans go through the same heat as you. Their clothes are adapted to their climate and traditions, and the question of covering the body in Morocco is valid for both women and men.

### **How Moroccans dress**

![Moroccan wear djellaba ](/uploads/1582210475891.jpg "Moroccan wear djellaba ")

Regarding color, there are differences among populations and tribes. To start with, the native berbers dress in very colorful manner, while the Arabs dress more austere and sober way, using mainly black and shades of grey. Also, in the desert and in more typical rural parts of Morocco, patterns of colors in scarves or of the djellaba are used to identify the tribe to which a person belongs.

Despite these systematic differences, when you walk the streets of Morocco, the colors are everywhere, especially in the handkerchiefs, and this is always reflecting the sun and the joy of summer. There are lots of shine, lots of embroidery, many embellishments, many earrings and rings on the fingers of Moroccans, finger sandals are also widely used.

If you are spending more than a week or two in Morocco, we advise investing in a traditional Moroccan kaftan, jabador or jilaba. They are cheerful and delicious clothes to enter the local climate, a great way to delve into the culture. You will have fun combining prints and enjoying the color. Jeans and leggings are also great choices - Moroccans wear them in long, colorful sleeve shirts. They are practical, comfortable and can be adapted to your tastes and personality. Also, depending on your destination, they will be ideal for the hike you will make.

### **Everything depends on the path and the climate**

In the case of southern Morocco, the temperatures can be from 18ºC to 7ºC in the Marrakesh night. Already in the winter, the differentiation can be of 21ºC of day to 3ºC in the night of the Sahara. If it is too hot, the skirts play a better role than the pants. If it is very cold, pants with long, long-sleeved blouses also fit well. We also advise face scarf to escape the sand in the eyes of the Sahara Desert - this itinerary includes some walking times and the weather varies from days of sun, rain and even snow forecast - which is rare, but happens around five days a year on the spot. Ideally, prepare a well-thought-out bag. That is, have cotton socks, scarf, gloves, long sleeve shirts and short sleeves, thermal pants and coats. Tights can also be a nice extra layer on colder days or to wear with dresses and skirts on a day that you want to vary.

### **And finally, what to wear on the feet?**

If you go to Casablanca or Marrakech, you can think of heels or urban and night shoes for parties or dinners that are within your planning. But if your destination has lots of land with dirt, sand and stones, in general, high heels and uncomfortable shoes are totally expendable. In such cases, bet on a good hiking shoe or trekking boot. It is essential to have at least one pair of waterproof shoes for this time of year. A good idea is also a more airy shoe, being the ideal to take turns on days of milder temperatures and shorter walks. Remember to bring two pairs to the Sahara - the sand will come in and you will need to change your shoes at the end of the delicious journey.

### **Toiletries you may need**

Although not necessarily part of the clothing, thinking about hygiene products to travel is always very important. Your suitcase needs to meet your needs. As on any trip and knowing of the high temperatures you can get, carry sunscreen and lip balm. It is worth noting that in the case of hair dryers and electrical products, Moroccan outlet patterns are identical to those in Europe.

### **The clothes to wear in the desert**

To conclude, we reiterate this point that, although it has already been mentioned other times, it really needs to have a topic just for him. It is a bit difficult to walk in the desert, especially in places where the sand is very soft. If you need to climb a dune, some consider that the best option is to take off or with an open sandal. With shoes that have openings but are supposed to be closed, in a few minutes the sand will enter, causing great discomfort. Either that, or as already suggested, you might want to bring a few extra items to make your experience more comfortable.

Still thinking about the protection, carry a long scarf that you can wrap around your face to protect from the sun and sand. We recommend that you bring a small bag with you on this trip, not a giant suitcase. Clothes from the Sahara Desert just need to be functional. We also recommend a pair of wool socks or extra socks and a heavier jacket to sleep at night. Especially if you go in winter, hand warmers are even a necessary asset.

If you're still curious about what else you'll need on your wonderful journey through the desert, read our article starring only this theme.
