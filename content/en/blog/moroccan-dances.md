The culture of this region is a harmonious blend of Arab and Berber traditions. Unfortunately, such a phenomenon as the traditional Moroccan dance has not been studied enough. But this part of the folklore culture is very popular among the locals.

Moroccans, especially the villagers, dance on major festivals and important family celebrations. It's like a colorful performance accompanied by folk music and bright costumes. Great role is given to traditional musical instruments: tambourines, rattle, castanets, drums, etc.

Each region of Morocco has its own characteristic dances. They are performed in different ways in the north of the country, in the mountains, in the south, on the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Let us dwell in detail on certain types of art of rhythmic movement.

## **Guedra**

Guedra is a traditional Tuareg **Berber dance** from the Goulmime area in southern Morocco. The name of the dance comes from the name of a traditional pot called Guedra that is used to provide the percussion rhythm of the dance. Only women participate in the dance, and usually wear blue tunics and party dresses and head decorated with shells. In the guedra , a dancer totally covered with a veil, waves her captivating fingers. It is a tradition that is reproduced every Saturday, days of souk, in Guelmin, 200 km south of Agadir.

To carry out the Guedra, a group of women kneel in a circle. The group begins to sing and clap, and a woman stands at the center to perform a solo dance. The soloist begins her dance covered with a veil that will be progressively eliminated as she moves her hands and shoulders in sudden and rapid movements. As the dance intensifies, the women of the circle perform the characteristic sound with a tongue and sing in a louder voice.

The dancer, dressed in a long dress and covered with a broad cloth, makes smooth movements with her hands. The whole body is relaxed. The key components that this Moroccan dance absorbed are the rhythmic movements of the hands and the shaking of the hair with the body swinging from side to side. Sometimes a dancer even enters a trance during performance.

## **Shikhat**

The style became famous outside of Morocco for its special purpose. Professional shikat dancers wear tight-fitting costumes, with sequined cami-tops and long skirts or loose pants. The dance is characterized by sensual hip movements, pelvic undulations and sensual movements of the hand. Often, a light cloth on the hip is used to draw attention to the movements of the lower body. The music alternates between rhythmic percussion sections - which require fast, strong body movements - and softer parts that drive more sensual hip movements.

This is also a wedding dance, and traditionally it is performed by women at a wedding, gathered around the bride. If men are present, men can kneel in a circle and encourage the woman to continue her solo dance. They are dressed in bright outfits of straight cut, and around the waist a belt with a fringe is tied.

## **Haidus**

This Moroccan dance is like a pagan dance. It is accompanied necessarily by singing under the tambourines - musical instruments like tambourines.

Both women and men participate in the dance. All participants make undulations with the body. It uses Haidus for various solemn occasions: congratulations to newlyweds, meetings of dear guests, honoring warriors, etc.

## **Abidous**

The participating men sit in a circle playing wooden drums, while the women remain motionless in a larger circle. As the rhythm of the drums increases, women begin to increase the swinging with the rhythm. This dance is danced in a circle while surrounding the musicians. It is usually more common in the Middle Atlas area. It is usually related to the celebrations regarding agriculture.

## **Moroccan belly dance**

Strictly speaking, Moroccan belly dancing does not exist by itself. What dances in this country within the framework of the belly dance is a mixture of the Lebanese style (in which the movements are undulating and fast, the emphasis is on the thighs) and the popular Egyptian style (fast but at the same time smooth and relaxed). So, belly dancing is not even part of the culture of Morocco. In this country it is performed only for tourists, and not always on a professional level.

## **Moroccan dance in other cultures**

astern dance develops constantly and is often used in Western art productions. It is possible, for example, to meet him in the play based on G. Ibsen's play "Per Gynt", music to which was written by the famous Norwegian composer E. Grig.

According to the plot, a dreamy and detached from reality main character is forced to lead the life of a fugitive and wanderer. By the will of his destinies he brings in different parts of the world, including in Morocco. Here, a colorful scene for the Western spectator is played out. The main character crouches on the pillows, and in the meantime Anitra, the daughter of the Bedouin leader, and a group of other brightly dressed girls make rhythmic movements to the music. The image of the main dancer inspired many choreographers and artists.

Moroccan folk dances are a bright, colorful, cheerful and dynamic spectacle that can please not only the tourists, who are eager for exotic purposes, but also the representatives of this culture.
