Having a phenomenal time alone is an experience, in itself, essential. Traveling is one of the best ways to open your mind, inspire yourself and make your life an inspiration to the others. Solo travel helps you to be in touch with yourself and to be led by the ways that the journey will provide you. Well, if travel alone is so good, when we talk about journey and deep experiences, Morocco is for sure the right destination. If you are thinking of taking a solo trip in Morocco, weâ€™ve put together some tidbits and advice to help your plan.

### **1. Have a prior understanding of the Morocco Culture**

Understanding the history and culture before traveling to a country helps you to enjoy the trip better, since you will know some background information that will guide you. You do not need to know from birth to the thirtieth dynasty of the place, no way. Mainly because we advise to let Morocco surprise you. But it's interesting to know a bit about the story to better listen to the messages that Morocco will give - when you stop at a place, you will remember what you have read and will receive the energies completely.

### **2. Learn a few phrases in Arabic, French and even Spanish**

You probably already know this, but it's worth reiterating: besides being a form of respect, knowing basic phrases that will help you during your trip is an essential requirement to enjoy more carefree. Also puts you better in the culture, enabling more contact with citizens, tourists and people in general. In the case of Morocco, besides English that facilitates anywhere, French is compulsory in the country and Arabic and Berber are official languages. In the case of Spanish, it is more common in the northern regions, so it will depend on which Moroccan space will be your main destination. And that brings us to the third topic.

### **3. Map your own route in Morocco**

It's your trip, let yourself choose beforehand what you want to see or choose a tour that fits your needs perfectly. This part depends on your interests, your tastes, but there are always those must-see places that cannot be missed. In the case of Morocco, we can easily talk about the imperial cities, or the wonderful region between the desert and Marrakesh - full of gorges and rock formations, with its different ways of receiving sunlight, is ideal for lovers of good photographs. Also around Todra Gorges lies the Tinghrir palm grove, a fertile and magical place, giving this area a diversity of scenery and incredible nature.

Whichever way you choose, do not miss an opportunity to meet a cooperative of women of solidary ends, who cook delicious, sharp and harmonious dishes, combining a requirement of flavoring with the freshness of natural products, locally planted.

### **4. Have no fear**

Do not give up on your trip. Go! It is not worth abandoning the new ways for lack of company. It is very likely that your experience will be even richer and more interesting by being alone, getting to know yourself and enjoying your own company. You will gain a self-knowledge with which you never dreamed; will mature and will make many more friends than if accompanied. The world presented you with beautiful places like Morocco: give yourself this gift trip.
