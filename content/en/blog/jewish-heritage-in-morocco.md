## **First Jewish quarters in Morocco**

[Fes](/en/destinations/fez/ "Fes"), Morocco - Among the spicy souks and craft shops that line the turning points and alleys of the Mellahs, names given to the old Jewish neighborhoods of cities, there are traces of a rich history. Mixed with the shades of crimson and smells of smoke and mint, the traces of the Jewish past in Morocco remain.

The Jewish character of the old mellahs (plural of 'mellah', meaning 'salt' in Arabic and Hebrew) is tangible, not only because these immured quarters have Jewish cemeteries or preserved synagogues, but also because the Jewish community once lived there, giving birth to markets that, until today, are filled with staggering displays of small gifts: everything is fine silver, amber, there are light leather items, textiles, perfumes of Africa and elsewhere.

Between these shining objects, Jewish souvenirs, such as Pesach plates, pottery adorned with a Star of David, or centuries-old calendars with inscriptions in Hebrew, can be found.

These are the testimonies of a Jewish past in Morocco, freely presented among the antique shops and canopy aisles that are among the most touristic places in Morocco.

## **History of mellahs in Morocco**

Before the Inquisition, Morocco had a Jewish population that was born on its soil and whose presence dates to the period following the destruction of the Second Temple during the siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE.

These ancient Jewish communities settled and cohabited with the [Berbers](/en/blog/what-do-you-know-about-the-berber-people/ "What do you know about the Berber people?"), and only later, when the Sephardic Jews fled Spain to Morocco and the rest of North Africa - as the brilliant scholar Jewish Maimonides, who arrived from the Iberian Peninsula during what was considered the Golden Age of Judaism, that the Sephardic traditions took over the indigenous customs and Judaism practice of the old group.

The first mellah was created in 1438 in Fes, the oldest imperial city of Morocco, where Jews played an important development role, particularly thanks to their commercial skills and their regional contacts.

Although Jews were forced to live in these walled areas until the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.

Living in the mellahs was not always considered a disadvantage. They included spacious houses and their excellent geographical location, typically around the royal palace, was an advantage for the Jews as it provided them with better protection against possible attacks.

Yet, over time, the narrow streets of the neighborhoods have become engorged to end up swarming with people and have become synonymous with ghettos. The Jews were confined to the inner walls of dilapidated mellahs, the areas were associated with curses, 'salt' land, and so Jews were perceived in Moroccan society.

Historians claim that the term mellah also meant rituals to which the Jewish community should proceed: salting the heads of the Jews who were to be executed.

## **Nowadays**

In time, Morocco has become home to the largest Jewish population in the Arab world. Before the founding of the State of Israel, there were more than 350,000 Moroccan Jews scattered throughout the country in nearly 100 communities.

Under the rule of the current leader, King Mohammed VI, Morocco shows tolerance, if not kindness, for its inner Jewish community, for Jewish communities abroad but also for Israeli tourists.

The king had promised to restore the country's synagogues, and in 2013, he made good on his promise by providing funds to renovate Slat Alfayysiyne, a 17th-century Fes synagogue.

The country has not experienced a history of persecution of Jews in recent decades and has recognized the Jewish community's contributions to the richness of its culture and history.

Popular opinion about Jews is not very good, especially since Israel's creation in 1948. Yet, Morocco remains the most benevolent country in the Arab world towards Israel, even though there are growing voices in society to prevent the normalization of relations with Jerusalem, as evidenced by the two laws introduced into the legislature. last year that made all contact with Israel illegal.
