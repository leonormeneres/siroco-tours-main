Morocco is a fascinating country with an ancient history that has left its mark in the form of architectural jewels in many towns and cities of the country. Magnificent examples of historical architecture can be found in the many palaces scattered throughout Morocco.

Many cities have spectacular examples of Moroccan architecture and visitors will be amazed at the diversity and uniqueness of each building. Morocco has been faithful to its ancient traditions and cultures-not only in its lifestyle, but in its architectural style. They have managed to modernize their cities without losing the richness and beauty of the past.

Architecture in Morocco is a mixture of many cultures. This is not only seen in the building itself, also in the splendid gardens, extravagant decorations and the elaborate use of the cons and deep colors. The turbulent past of Morocco is reflected in the strong fortifications of the desert and the walls of the well protected palaces. It is also the style that the Moroccans choose to decorate the interiors of the buildings that convert these architectural wonders giving them a unique and majestic atmosphere.

Traditional country houses or palaces with integrated gardens are called **riad**s, which means the **"house with garden"**. Today these are mainly used as hotels or restaurants. Moroccan riads are known for their upscale amenities. They are tastefully furnished and often luxurious.

## **Ancient Architecture**

Ancient architecture (or what remains of it) has left its mark in northern Morocco. At the Hit-Parade ancient sites: **Volubilis** and its Roman city listed as a Unesco heritage since 1997. The former capital of Mauretania tingitana, built on the ancient Oualili, is planted in a beautiful site with olive trees, and bathed in sunlight. In the shadow of the village of Moulay Idriss and the foothills of the massive Zerhoun, capitol, baths, forum, triumphal arch, basilica and houses decorated with mosaics reflect centuries of **Roman occupation**. The site, grand as it is, must not eclipse the other ancient remains visible on Moroccan soil like Lixus, Banasa but also the archaeological site of Chellah in Rabat.

## **Berber Style**

Drawing its roots in time immemorial, Berber architecture has left its mark in the lands of southern Morocco. **Ksour** (fortified villages), **kasbah** (fortified houses) and **Agadir** (fortified granaries) decorated with **traditional geometric motifs** illustrate the magnificence of the Berber style. Made from raw earth, Berber constructions are enough materials available in the immediate environment. It is this organic matter, called rammed earth, which gives Berber architecture all its strength and beauty. Natural and uncluttered, the mud brick architecture blends gracefully into the southern landscapes. Because if it is ecological, adobe architecture is also fragile. In the absence of concrete measures, these castles of land and reeds, witnesses of the history of Morocco could disappear forever. While waiting for the rescue, guest houses, eco-lodges and other houses of charms' appropriate the virtues of the adobe habitat.

## **Portuguese Influence**

El Jadida, Essaouira, Asilah, Azemmour or Safi. All these cities have in common with their architectural heritage linked to the Lusitanian presence on Moroccan soil. Witnesses of 354 years of Portuguese lust, the defensive fortifications, facing the blue waters of the Atlantic, recall a time when Mazagan (now El Jadida) and Mogador (now Essaouira) were home to impregnable military enclaves. If the time of the "Algarve beyond" is well and truly over, these Moroccan cities retain superb examples of Portuguese architecture that punctuate long sandy beaches flooded with light.

## **The Arab - Andalusian Tradition**

Far from being representative of the architectural diversity of Morocco, the Arab-Andalusian style is however that which one thinks immediately when one evokes the Sherifian Kingdom. Minarets, mosques, caravanserais, fortifications, monumental gates and palaces covered with calligraphy and arabesques evoke the richness and refinement of this urban tradition inherited from Al Andalus. Imported from Córdoba by the Almoravids, the Arab-Andalusian tradition enjoyed its golden age in the Almohad dynasty which saw great minarets flourish like the Koutoubia (Marrakech) and the Hassan Tower (Rabat). The key words of Almohad architects and craftsmen are purity and grandeur. Under the Mérinides, the austerity gives way to the finesse of the decor inspired by the delicate art of the Nasrid of Granada. The following dynasties saw the birth of the greatest builders of Morocco like the Sultan of Iran Ahmed El Mansour and the sovereign Alaouite Moulay Ismaïl ...

## **Colonial Architecture**

The colonial architecture of Morocco propels the traveler in the first half of the XXth century. Casablanca and Rabat, who lived then in the era of the French protectorate, see a new urban space flourish under the leadership of Marshal Lyautey, resident general of the time. Colonial houses, Art Nouveau buildings, Art Deco buildings and buildings of neo-Moorish or Bauhaus style break through in the new, so-called European neighborhoods, which take their marks alongside the old centers - the medinas. Today, these old historic centers scattered throughout the cities of Morocco evoke more the decrepit neighborhoods of Havana than the roaring twenties. Threatened by the indifference of the authorities and property speculation in large urban centers, the colonial heritage is at the center of attention of heritage protection associations.

## **Contemporary Style**

This is not the style we think about when we talk about Morocco. Yet contemporary architecture may well change the face of the Kingdom in the years to come. The Morocco Mall (Casablanca), the National Library (Rabat) and the headquarters of Maroc Telecom (Rabat) have already been talked about. The CasArts Grand Theater of Casablanca, the big theater of Raba and the highest tower of Africa, which should find its marks in the valley of Bou Regreg in Rabat in a few years!
