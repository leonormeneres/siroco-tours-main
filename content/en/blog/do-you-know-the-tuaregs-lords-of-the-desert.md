The innermost part of the Sahara desert has a human contingent that has occupied its area for many centuries - a contingent that ranges from one to half a million people.

Being an old trade and communication route between the extremes of the African continent, the so-called Trans-Saharan trade route is historically controlled by the Tuaregs, who dominate the best routes.In fact, they ended up indiscriminately receiving the nickname "lords of the desert" mainly because of their nomadism and great knowledge of the desert routes. Their knowledge is so much that they were hired by other tribes for protection. Oh, and it should be added that the Tuareg never eat camel meat.

Unfortunately, today, salt caravans are not very common (the old caravans with up to hundreds of dromedaries, with men walk in front and behind, setting the pace).

### **The name Tuareg**

![Tuareg traditional dances](/uploads/Tuareg_Tradition_Dance.jpg "Tuareg traditional dances")

The name of the Tuareg (or imuhag, in Tamasheq) refers to the people of the Berber ethnic group who inhabit the high desert area of ​​the Sahara in North Africa. In fact, many Moroccans are descendants of Berbers - it is said that about three-quarters of Moroccans.

Epistemologically, the term Tuareg is Arabic, but is believed to have come from Europeans. It is more the plural of Targui, and, according to some investigators, would derive from the Arab verb taraka, that means to abandon, or "abandoned by the gods". Some understand it as a clear reference to those who have left Islam and have therefore become renegades, or reference to the region they inhabit, in an inhospitable and hostile thesis to human occupation.

Others also rescue the meaning of the Arabic word tharik, which means "way," to designate the Tuareg as "thieves of the ways." It refers to the control they exercised over the great routes of transarian caravans, and to the robberies and looting perpetrated to the black populations of the Sahel. Finally, some argue that such designation is given to them because they inhabited the Targa valley.

The fact is that the Tuaregs call themselves Kel Tamaseq or Kel Tamajaq, referring to the language with which they communicate (for it means speakers of Tamasheq). They also accept the terms Imouhar and Imuhagh, or Imashaghen, referring to the freedom with which they build their society. They are identified as the Tamust Nation.

To us, it remains to be noticed by the unusual beauty. The tagelmust, famous turban, dyes them beautiful blue. The "Blue Men".

### **The history of the Tuareg people**

![Tuareg men with a camel](/uploads/ap_811766796896.jpg "Tuareg men with a camel")The most inland area of ​​the Sahara has been occupied by peoples for many centuries, making it an ancient route of communication and trade between the two extremes of the African continent, being this trade route called "trans-Saharan". The Tuaregs have always controlled their best routes.

The actual origin of the people and the term itself is unknown - it may be Yemenite, Egyptian, or some ancient European tribe. They are nomads, pastoralists, moving through the desert on camels and horses. They were one of the first people to occupy the Sahara. Despite the black skin, similar to that of black African peoples further south, they are of the Berber population of North Africa. They practice the Islamic religion, which arrived in the region around the twelfth century, but their beliefs have ancestral influences - believe in juun, which is the spirit of nature, or Kel Asuf spirit and Qur'an divinization. They inherited pre-Islamic customs and traditions, such as respect for the elements of nature and female freedom, especially their sexuality.

They are sometimes judged as "not very strict in Islam," because nomadism makes it impossible for them to perform duties like Ramadan. They synthesize between Sunni and pre-Islamic animistic traditions.

### **Tuareg Culture**

Society is defined by castes, with a very determining hierarchy. Imajeren is the name of the noblest, highest caste consisting of warriors carrying a traditional sword (called Takoba), which is shaped similar to the medieval swords used in the Crusades.

The Tuaregs live scattered, spread by countries of the region: Niger, Libya, Burkina Faso, Algeria and Mali. Most of this people are in Mali and Niger, but it is in Algeria that we find the most important groups politically. The Tuareg have important centers: such as Timbuctu, Gao and Kidal in Mali, and Agadez in northern Niger.

In the past, Timbuctu, a center formed by them, was a very important trans-Saharan trade center, as well as a research center that had a university and a large number of intellectuals at the height of the Islamic intelligentsia during the low Middle Ages period. At that time, more than ten centuries ago, numerous libraries in the area were created. Today, they are the target of several international organizations that have projects aimed at finding and restoring old books kept by ancestors.

It is estimated that there are between 1 million and 1.5 million Tuareg. They have a variety of languages, originating in Berber. The main one is tamasheq, but there are others - like tamahaq, tahaggart, tayart, tawallammat and the tetserret. Such languages ​​are currently written either in Latin alphabet, or Arabic script or even a proper alphabet developed for the Berber languages ​​called tifinagh. The entire written Tuareg is made in tefinag (or tifinagh), composed of ideographic characters. Despite this, the culture is mostly oral, being a people who are not used to reading or writing in their own language, usually using Arabic.

In the Sahara region rainfall is very rare and temperatures vary widely - by day they reach 50º C and at night they can reach -5º C.

Among the customs, they differ from other Berber peoples for not using tattoos. Another custom, both men and women paint their eyes with kohl, a black powder. They wear long, wide clothing to protect the body from the sun and the circular air. These long tunics are also help protect against the night chill. The men wear an indigo blue veil covering their entire face and leaving only their eyes out, called Tagelmust, even between relatives. The belief is that this veil would protect them from evil spirits. In practice, it helps protect the face from the strong sun and the bursts of sand.

### **Boubou fluttering and blue turban**

In the middle of the desert they are a striking apparition: they emerge from nowhere without noise, with turban to the eye and takuba (traditional sword) to the belt, proud lords of all that dust populated by prickly acacias, brown shrubs and smooth dunes.

Guedra is their typical dance, made to bless newborns, weddings, visits and friends, performed to the sound of a typical drum, made of stone, clay or metal (usually using an improvised pan) and covered with goat skin.

His means of locomotion is the camel, crossing the invisible borders with crossed legs, as one walks in an armchair. In this position, only the hands, feet and eyes can be seen from the body, since the turban of meters and the thin layers of clothing protect from the hot sun and the heat.

The feed is based on sheep's milk and its derivatives. They usually slaughter animals only for big parties. When they find an oasis (desert area with plants), women and children harvest dates and other native fruits and replenish water supplies. If you go to visit the Tuareg people, you will drink an excellent mint tea.

Besides tea, the straw huts, the appreciation of dates, oranges and beautiful pomegranates that inhabit well-kept oases, as in Timia, are remarkable characteristics.
