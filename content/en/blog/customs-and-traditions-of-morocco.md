Morocco is an African country with a very young population, most of its inhabitants, about 70%, are under 30, being in total 26 million people.

It has many traditional customs that in other parts of the world may be very curious. For example, if a Western tourist likes to wear light [clothing](/en/blog/what-to-wear-in-morocco/ "What to wear in Morocco?") you will need to make an exception when it comes to Morocco and much more if you try to enter a mosque.

Morocco is a country full of [traditions and customs](/en/blog/customs-and-traditions-of-morocco/ "Morocco traditions and customs") due to the [cultural](/en/blog/culture-of-morocco/ "Culture") influences that are, African, Arab and Mediterranean. One of the most deeply rooted customs is the consumption of tea. The infusion is taken all the time and it is common to share the drink with guests, and even visitors to shops. It is a sign of hospitality and due to the high temperatures in some areas of the country, it is to avoid dehydration. Regarding the hospitality shown to share tea with strangers, it should be noted that in Morocco as in the Arab world, a guest will always be well received, even in the case of a person who they barely know, sometimes you are also invited to eat.

Moroccans are more formal in social than most Westerners situations. In the greetings, they usually ask about the state of health and well-being of all members of the family. Always greet with your right hand, as the left is traditionally considered impure. Kiss on the cheeks is practical between members of the same sex, especially if they are friends, but should not perform between opposite sexes unless they are very close.

Also, at the time of the meal a man who is not from this country will be surprised by the abundance, so it will not be impolite to leave food on the plate. And when the visitor is invited to a dinner of a Moroccan family, must wash their hands, and should not try any bite without hearing the prayer that the owner of the house will do.

Another important point in customs is that you must remove your shoes when entering a home.

Entering the mosques in Morocco and in the Arab world in general is not allowed to the "infidels". I.e., only Muslims can enter the facilities. However, there are certain places that are free to access, such as the Hassan II mosque in [Casablanca](/en/destinations/casablanca/ "Casablanca").

It is common to see men hand in hand on the streets, this is a sign of friendship as not being allowed to public demonstrations of affection between a Muslim man and woman, so men show friendship through physical contact.

When you visit markets, shops and other places to buy souvenirs and [handicraft](/en/blog/crafts-of-morocco/ "Crafts of Morocco"), it is common to bargain for prices. In fact, at times it is necessary to do so due to high prices of certain items. It is also common that the products do not have the price tag, waiting for people to haggle. Also, in the Arabic culture it is a very common social act. In fact, if the seller's price is accepted at first, the seller can become angry. The usual is to propose a price much lower and from that basis agree a more balanced price that benefits both parties.

In some restaurants in the country, the consumption of alcohol is permitted, and alcoholic beverages are served. However, it is not the general rule and the visitor must understand this aspect. Restaurants are not required to sell alcohol compulsorily and it is very bad to consume in public or walking the streets with a few drinks. Respect is essential to enjoy the stay in Morocco.

### **Moroccan Wedding**

Another custom which has passed from generation to generation is referred to the women, who must be virgins at marriage and therefore the pre-marital sex is forbidden. Marriage is a union for loving relationships that want to escape the silence and the criticisms of society, thus also the family is too important to the Moroccans.

Perhaps even in a greater extent than in other cultures, the family is quite sacred in Morocco. The admiration and respect for elders join the place of priority for children in the home. Of course, family nuclei are often distinguished by union and fraternity, always led by men, followed by women, who in recent decades have gained some ground in society. And with respect to the presence of women in the daily life, the female elder are with more power of decision in the families.

The celebration of the ' Aqiqa "(Moroccan Baptism), or the seventh day of the birth of the baby, is a festival that is of importance in the social and family life, the preparations to receive the infants vary from region to another country.

Being a predominantly young country, elders are regarded due to its scarce presence in homes and often the heads of families, in this respect the value of women also charged an enhancement in households.

Although it is not expected that non-Muslims to fast during Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking in private places, is considered polite. At any time of the year, but especially during Ramadan, show respect both in attire and behavior if you are near a mosque.

Photographing a mosque is usually acceptable if you are not too close to the interior or photograph people praying.

These and other customs are necessary for those who plan a view towards the African continent, to reach Morocco and to approach a little closer to their traditions and customs.

### **Should do in Morocco**

![Moroccan dinner table](/uploads/1024px-Moroccan_food-10-1.jpg "Moroccan dinner table")

* As in any country where the [culture](/en/blog/culture-of-morocco/ "Culture of Morocco") is different, it is necessary to adapt to local customs.
* Eat with your right hand. If you must share a table with Moroccans since the left hand is considered unclean.
* Accept invitations to tea. This is the best way to sympathize with the Moroccans. But be careful as it is commonly used as a tactic to sell you something from the store and may be involved in an embarrassing situation.
* Take off your shoes when entering a House. It is best to ask the homeowner what they would prefer. Moroccan houses tend to be full of carpet and it can disturb that if we step on them with our shoes.

### **Not To do in Morocco**

![Cute Moroccan kid](/uploads/1582274929206.jpg "Cute Moroccan kid")

* Do not attempt to enter the mosques. There are only a few mosques around the country that allow entry to non-Muslims, be sure before going into one.
* Do not take photographs of a person without asking for permission. In some areas of Morocco, it will offend them taking a picture without permission, especially if photography is a woman or even a girl. Ask permission before taking the picture, since it can be wrapped in an unpleasant situation.
* No money to child beggars. It is very important that no money to child beggars, even pens or sweets. It is very fashionable among tourists to give candy, pens and money to children, but this behavior is very harmful for them, since we are encouraging children to go to school instead of begging on the streets. Education is free in the country and all children should be attending school, but many of them see that they can get money and sweets in a quick way out of school, so they drop out classes to chase after tourists.
* Do not reject an invitation to tea. Deny a tea to a Moroccan may offend you. We must be very tactful when it comes to doing it.
* Do not discuss issues about religion and the King. Try not to talk about politics or religion and drugs.
* Do not wear provocative clothes. Especially women and especially if go to visit the surroundings of sacred places (mosques, temples...). It is advisable to wear discreet not to offend. The Moroccans are not accustomed to women go light clothing, which can make people uncomfortable.
* It is strictly forbidden to photograph the border, military and police checkpoints or airport facilities.
