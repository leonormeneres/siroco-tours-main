In the [culture of Morocco](/en/blog/culture-of-morocco/ "culture of Morocco") tea is considered a very important part, so that it is classified as an art form in this country. The most consumed is the popular Moroccan style mint tea, which is served both: during meals and throughout the day. It is considered a beverage of hospitality, since it is usually served when there are guests.

Contrary to how it is done with the [food](/en/blog/9-typical-moroccan-foods/ "9 Typical Moroccan Foods ") in Morocco, that is cooked and served by the woman, the tea is always in the hands of the man, since it is this member of the family who is in charge of doing it and of serving it. One thing of great importance and that you must take into account is that it is of very little kindness, and almost an offense, to reject a tea that you have been served, so it is best that you drink it, if you want to close a deal with a merchant or cause a good impression.

As for history, there are different views about when and how tea came to Morocco. One of the stories is that teas were brought to Morocco during the eighteenth century that Queen Elizabeth I of England wanted to help the British tableware vendors to sell their products within the Moroccan upper classes. In the Sahara of Morocco, the most accepted version of the story is that the tea has become popular because it indicates that the water has been boiled and it is thus a guarantee that this water is free of unwanted microbes.

## **Preparation of Moroccan tea**

The preparation of this drink is different depending on the region. You can usually notice that the tea in the north of Morocco is sweeter than in the south and in some parts, they add other ingredients such as pieces of pine tree cones or orange flowers. During the winter, when the mint is scarcer, it is common added to the drink absinthe tea leaf either replacing the other herb or supplementing it, which adds a different flavor and makes it a bit more bitter.

The tea is prepared on a metal tray, in teapots also made of metal, often stainless-steel alloys, others, silver teapots in which boiling water is poured, or that are placed directly on the fire.

The tea is poured into a glass from a certain height several times, so that a light foam forms, until it is well mixed. It is a way for it to oxygenate, enhancing its flavor. Tradition says that tea should be served three times: the first glass is "bitter as life", the second "strong as love", and the third, "sweet as death". Once the tea is prepared in the teapot, it is served in colored glass cups, which give a very picturesque aspect to the ceremony.

If you travel to Morocco, be prepared to drink a delicious dose of mint tea during your stay. The streets of Morocco are a real feast of drinks. There is no shop, street vendor or restaurant that does not include this drink to accompany any typical meal. In the souks it is usual to receive customers with a glass of mint tea as a symbol of hospitality.
