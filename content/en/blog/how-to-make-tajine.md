If couscous is the dish of Friday, the national dish of Morocco it's tajine! Specialty of Berber origin, tajine comes in 1001 recipes that vary according to the season, the ingredients available and the mood of the cook.

### **1. Just dosage of spices and aromatic herbs**

The Moroccan tajine **must-haves** are **fresh coriander, chopped parsley, garlic, onion, cumin, ginger, sweet pepper, turmeric, salt, pepper and olive oil**.

Saffron, candied lemon, butter and olives (purple or green) are sometimes part of the game, as are honey, cinnamon, almonds and sesame seeds that are happy to be served in sweet-salted tajines.

The **meat or fish**, previously marinated, well dosed with spices are placed in the center of the tajine then covered with **vegetables and/or dried fruits** according to the chosen ingredients.

Just add a little water to the preparation and go for 1:30 to 2:30, stewing with very soft fire!

### **2. Cooking tajine... in a tajine(a real) terracotta!**

Forget cooking tajine in the pressure cooker. Even though pressure cooking is considered faster, cooking in a traditional tajine is a guarantee of the true taste of the original tajine.

The tajine, you have understood, refers to both the dish (the contents) and the cooking utensil (the container) which is presented as a hollow dish surmounted by a bell-shaped cone (or flying saucer). Made in terracotta, the traditional tajine allows a healthy and slow cooking, little greedy in fat (a trickle of olive oil is enough) and recognized for its nutritional values. Steam condensed into fine droplets embraces the walls of the terracotta cone before marrying the cooking juices. The faithful reproduction of the flavors is 100% guaranteed!

You are not equipped with a terrine tajine and would like to make a tajine recipe with chicken and olives? The most faithful alternative to cooking the traditional tajine is the good old cast iron casserole. The contents of the casserole, stewed, will then be transferred and prepared in a tajine dish at the time of eating.

### **3. On a brazier**

While tajine cooking can of course be done on gas, the Moroccan stew is traditionally stewed on a brazier, also called kanoun. The brazier is a terracotta pottery composed of a hearth intended to receive the embers of the burning coal. Cooking tajine with embers fire guarantees a slow and gentle cooking, at low and regular temperature.

Suitable for outdoor cooking, the brazier is the traditional cooking utensil of tajine. Before the introduction of the cooks in the Moroccan houses, all the culinary preparations cooked on the brazier. Today, there are braziers topped with smoking tajines, aligned on the edges of country and mountain roads and in some medinas. In modern kitchens, the brazier is replaced using a heat diffuser that is stuck between the flames of the tajine gas to prevent it from splitting. It should be noted that terracotta tajines do not support induction hobs.

### **4. Tajine tasting "the Moroccan way"**

It's ready! The tajine is then placed at the center of the round table and the assembly gathered on the benches of the Moroccan salon. When the tapered lid is lifted, you instantly capsize in a cloud of perfumed vapors. It remains to grab a piece of khobz (bread) in the bread basket and place to tasting! Each draw directly into the dish with his fingers and a piece of bread (sometimes replaced by a fork).

The tajine is the ultimate convivial dish, often enjoyed with the family. And no, it is not eaten with semolina as in some French restaurants but salads (input), olives (often) and seasonal fresh fruit (dessert).

Enjoy your meal!
