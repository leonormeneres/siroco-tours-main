During the period between 2010 and 2015, the cities of Morocco filmed 150 films and foreign musicians, worth 281 million dollars, due to the most important films filmed in the Kingdom of Morocco to the United States of America, in addition to French films and some medium British series.

The oldest film in Morocco dates back nearly 120 years. In 1897, the French filmmaker Louis Lumière filmed his first Moroccan film, "Le Chevrier marocain”, the oldest foreign film to be filmed in the kingdom, if Luis Lumiere considered it a graphic boom. The discovery of the Moroccan territories is a film that is called for the advent of directors, screenwriters and putting the feet of Moroccan cinema on the track.

## **1. Casablanca**

Few large metropolises owe as much to the cinema as the economic capital of Morocco and that even though the film that bears his name does not contain a single real shot of the city. But whoever searches for **Rick's Café** will find it thanks to the initiative of an American girl in love with both the country and the film. It has perfectly recreated its environment and you just need to say Play it again, Sam so that we meet again Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in one of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema. On the other hand, there are entire neighborhoods like the New Medina of 1923 that take us directly to that exotic Morocco passed through the celluloid screen.

## **2. Tangier**

Surely there is no other city in the country where so many films have been shot that, in one way or another, have continued to feed the myth and legend that surrounds the most international enclave of Morocco. From **Sheltering Sky,** directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, where the character played by John Malkovich wanders nostalgically by the Hotel Minzah or the place of the souk Chico, to the **Naked Lunch** by David Cronenberg, which recreates the experiences of William Burroughs between dream and reality. Passing through several films by André Téchiné, by Ricardo Franco or **the Bourne Ultimatum**, where such emblematic places as the Hotel Velázquez, the Café de Paris or the Boulevard Pasteur appear. Cinema has always felt a special weakness for Tangier, although perhaps none has been able to portray it as Farida Benlyazid in the **La vida perra de Juanita Narboni.**

## **3. Marrakech**

![The stills from movie "The Man Who Knew Too Much"](/uploads/the_man_who_knew_too-much-8.jpg 'The stills from movie "The Man Who Knew Too Much"')

The most international and influential Film Festival, not only of Morocco but of all North Africa, is completing its seventeenth edition this year. And it is that the red City long ago entered the world of celluloid through the big door thanks to Alfred Hitchcock. Who does not remember Doris Day singing “what will be, will be” in **The Man Who Knew Too Much** (1956)? Although the real star of the film was the hotel La Mamounia that already, then, was considered one of the great ones. Now, that myth continues to endure thanks to a spectacular reform carried out by Jacques Garcia, who has turned it into a real palace of a Thousand and One Nights. It is still home to the great figures who come to the festival and many of the rich and famous who come to Marrakech looking for that movie town.

## **4. Ouarzazate**

![atlas studio](/uploads/17020353334_f8c6295430_b.jpg "atlas studio")

Considered the current capital of Moroccan cinema, Ouarzazate , at the gates of the Sahara, has spent years devoted to the film industry, which offers unique conditions. It has several studios, one transformed into the Museum of Cinema, in front of the Kasbah of Taourirt and where you can see countless sets of vintage films such as **Jesus of Nazareth**. Among the most successful spaces highlights the throne of King Solomon. Other large studios such as the Atlas, where famous films such as **Lawrence of Arabia** or **Babel** have been shot. Everywhere there are decorations and even the signaling of the streets reproduces a clapperboard.

## **5. Ait Ben Haddou**

![Beautiful kasbah of Ait Ben Haddou](/uploads/1600px-Morocco,_Souss-Massa-Draa_Region,_Ouarzazate_Province,_Kasbah_Tifoultoute.jpeg "Beautiful kasbah of Ait Ben Haddou")

Among all the kasbahs or fortified villages built in clay in the south of Morocco, none has been used so many times in movies like this one, declared a World Heritage Site, a few kilometers north of Ouarzazate. From **Gladiator** to the **James Bond OO7: High tension**, passing by John Huston's **The Man Who Could Reign**, or Michael Scorsese's **The Last Temptation of Christ**, dozens of films have used this picturesque natural setting. It is not uncommon, on the other hand, to meet with workers building extensions of their walls to be properly destroyed during the next filming.

## **6. Essaouira**

![The stills from movie "Othello"](/uploads/movie_2_121016_600.jpg 'The stills from movie "Othello"')

Although it has not yet made a film that really makes known this former Portuguese colony, the most attractive population of the Moroccan Atlantic coast already had its moment of cinematographic glory 60 years ago by the hand of **Orson Wells**. The author of Citizen Kane chose her to shoot the **Othello**, taking advantage of its medieval fortifications and the mysterious atmosphere of its medina. To thank him, the city erected a monument in the main square that can still be seen, in addition to giving his name to the Orson Welles hotel. Since then Essaouira has been used by great blockbusters such as **Alexander the Great**.

## **7. Fez**

![The poster of movie"Ladies and Gentlemen"](/uploads/91jaYt5bc3L._RI_.jpg 'The poster of movie"Ladies and Gentlemen"')

The best-preserved Medina in North Africa, declared a World Heritage Site, has not gone unnoticed by the cinema and we have seen it in several films. The best known has been **Ladies and Gentlemen**, by Claude Lelouch and played by Jeremy Irons, who in the film travels all over Morocco in a state of semi-amnesia that does not seem to prevent him from traveling. Although the city appears in all its splendor, the highlight is the Palais Jamai, the former residence of the Pasha, today converted into one of the most charismatic hotels in the country.

## **8. Tetouan**

![The stills from movie "Death for Sale"](/uploads/death-for-sale.jpg 'The stills from movie "Death for Sale"')

Although during the era of the protectorate, it served as the setting for some war movies such as **Ruta Gloriosa**, directed by Fernando Delgado in 1925, one must wait until recent years to rediscover Tetuan on both the big screen and the small one. On the one hand, the new Moroccan cinema has agreed with **Death for Sale**, director Faouzi Bensaidi, being selected by the Moroccan Cinematographic Center (CCM) to represent Morocco at the 2013 Oscars.
