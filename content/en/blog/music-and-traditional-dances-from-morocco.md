In Morocco, music marks the rhythm of everyday life. In addition to its mission in this area, it animates the family parties and the "moussem"(festival).

We can distinguish between various types of music and dance. The music of Arab influence, classical or of Andalusian origin and the new popular and modern ones. Berber music, traditional rural and mountains that vary with the tribes.

In many cases this music is derived from Sufism such as Eisawa, Hamadcha, Samaa, Hadra, and Gnawa Music.  At Fes in April, they are performed at the Sufi Culture Festival.
