Yennayer is the holiday celebrating the transition to the new year by the Berbers. It is the only non-Muslim festival common to all peoples of North Africa. In each region, it gives rise to various festivities and family meals.

## **A little history**

The history of the Berbers goes back 10,000 years before Christ. However, the starting point of the Berber calendar is the year 950 BC, when the Berber king was enthroned Pharaoh of Egypt and founded the XXII Dynasty that reigned over Egypt until 715 BC. This date is mentioned in the Bible and thus constitutes the first date of Berber history on a written support.

This day corresponds to January 12 of the Gregorian calendar. Like the other civilizations in the World (Russian, Chinese, Irish, Arabic, etc.), the Berbers thus had their own very old calendar, based both on the changes of seasons and the different cycles of vegetation that determine the crucial moments in agriculture, and the positioning of the stars, such as the moon and the sun.

Therefore, the Berbers celebrate the new year on 12 January, which corresponds to the 1st day of the month Yennayer, also the first day of the Julian calendar.

## **The celebration of Yennayer**

For the Berbers, Yennayer is first and foremost a gateway to the new year and called 'tabburt useggwass' (the door of the year). Its celebration is explained by the importance given to the **rites and superstitions** of the time, some of which still exist today. The period draws attention because the season corresponds to the approach of the **breaking of the provisions** kept for the winter. It is therefore necessary to renew one's spiritual strength by appealing rites. At this time of year, the rite must symbolize wealth. Thus, for the new year started to be more fruitful and the land more fertile, it is necessary to purify and to clean the premises.

## **Rituals**

For the new year to be prosperous, several purification rites are practiced: clean the house, purify it with fresh herbs, sweep all the pieces to drive out misery, etc.

The ritual symbolizes the expulsion of evil forces and spirits to make room for the beneficial spirits that will sustain us year-round. If the means allow it, will be sacrificed as many animals as there are family members. Tradition has retained the sacrifice of one rooster per man, one chicken per woman and both together for pregnant women so as not to forget the future baby. In the absence of meat, each family member will be represented by an egg.

## **Dinner**

For the occasion, families traditionally share a couscous meal with poultry. The meal is out of the ordinary and must be plentiful to symbolize abundance for the coming year.

Various sweets can be on the menu: donuts, pancakes, dried fruits like dried figs, almonds and hazelnuts.

On this day dinner will be served late and must be hearty, which in the eyes of the Berbers augurs a plentiful year. The meat of the sacrificed animal will be served according to the rite. During the dinner, a ceremony is held to preserve the absentees and to make the year be good. Absentees will not be forgotten spoons arranged by the mother symbolize their presence and a symbolic proportion will be left in the collective dish, supposed to bring together all the forces of the family.

After the meal it is necessary to check if everyone has **eaten up**. It is the hostess (the grandmother or the mother) who asks the question to the children to know if they ate their hunger: the answer is becqua neswa (yes, we have eaten and are satiated). So, it would upset the hostess if you don’t finish your meal.

The party keeps its flavor during the few days following the event.

## **Berber New Year traditions**

As yennayer also symbolizes longevity, they often associate family events:

•  first haircut of little boys

•  weddings

•  agricultural initiation rites: send the children to the fields to pick fruits and vegetables.

In some areas, children dress up during the month of yennayer and each makes his own mask, before going from house to house asking for treats.
