The state religion of Morocco is Sunni Islam, which 99% of the population profess. As is known, in Sunni Islam there are 4 basic schools of Shariah law: Hanafi, Shafi'i, Hanbali, Maliki. It is the last that is dominant in Morocco. King of Morocco Mohammed VI calls himself a direct descendant of the Prophet and bears the title of the Commander of the Faithful, thus combining secular and religious power in one person. The ruling party in Morocco today is the Islamist Justice and Development Party.

Muslims see their religion as the last and most perfect in the chain of three "book" monotheistic religions, the first two in which are Judaism and Christianity. Christians and Jews are recognized by Muslims as "people of the book" and many prophets from the Old and New Testaments are respected in the Qur'an, the holy book of Muslims, under Arabic names (Abraham = Ibrahim, Moses = Musa, Jesus = Isa, etc.).

## **5 pillars of Islam**

![arabic calligraphy](/uploads/ayat-al-kursi-islam-muslims-arabic-typography-calligraphy-typography-traditional-arabic-islamic.jpg "arabic calligraphy")

According to Islamic doctrine, every Muslim should worship on God's five pillars:

1. the recognition of monotheism and the fact that Mohammed is the Prophet of Allah
2. daily five times prayer
3. making a mandatory donation to the poor
4. observance of fasting during the month of [**Ramadan**](/en/blog/travel-in-morocco-during-ramadan/ "Travel in Morocco during Ramadan ")
5. the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in life (subject to the availability of funds and opportunities

Wherever you are in Morocco, you are sure to hear the azan 5 times a day - a call to **prayer**, the first of which is heard before sunrise. Despite the fact that most of the Moroccans pray only on Fridays or holidays, you can see a lot of such people who, having neglected everyone, begin to make a prayer right in the middle of a noisy busy street. On Friday noon, life in Morocco practically freezes for a few hours: after a long prayer at the mosque, people gather with their families, colleagues and friends at home, in the workplace, in a restaurant or on the street, to dine with the traditional Moroccan dish - [Couscous](/en/blog/couscous/ "Couscous").

**Assistance** to the needy is an important part of the Moroccan culture. It is even said that the poor in Morocco do not starve, because they can always rely on a help from others.

**Zakat** - a tax of 2.5% of the accumulated wealth(obligatory alms-giving).

**Sadaqah**(voluntary alms) - is encouraged .

The [custom](/en/blog/customs-and-traditions-of-morocco/ "custom") of giving alms and helping others is one of the beautiful traits of the Moroccan and Muslim[ culture](/en/blog/culture-of-morocco/ "Culture of Morocco") in general.

## **Muslim holidays in Morocco**

![muslim woman sitting in sunlight](/uploads/sunlight-woman.jpg "muslim woman sitting in sunlight")

The basis for the Muslim calendar is the lunar year, therefore the dates of Muslim holidays are shifted annually for 10-11 days. All Muslim holidays officially begin after sunset on the day preceding the calendar date of the holiday.

In the whole Muslim world there are only two main holidays:

[**Eid-al-fitr**](/en/blog/eid-al-fitr/ "Eid al-Fitr")  the holiday of ending the fasting, celebrated on the first day after Ramadan. On this day, all Moroccans wear new clothes, go to a festive prayer in the mosque, prepare a sumptuous meal and visit relatives and friends. During the holiday all public and private institutions are closed for several days, many people take an extra weekend to reunite with their families in other cities.

**Eid al-Adha** (Arabic: "Feast of Sacrifice".), the largest Muslim festival in the world, which is celebrated on the 10th day of Dhul-hijjah(approximately 2 months and 1 week after the end of Ramadan). In this month, Muslims traditionally perform the Hajj- a pilgrimage to Mecca, the culmination of which is the ceremony of sacrifice.

In addition to these two main Muslim holidays in Morocco, **Eid-al-Mawlid** and **Ashura** are still celebrated .

**Eid-al-Mawlid** - the birthday of the Prophet - is also a public holiday and a day off in Morocco. On this day, nothing special is happening, except for the festive prayer in the mosque.

**Ashura** - a holiday celebrated on the 10th day of the month of Muharram in the Muslim calendar, marks the day in which Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, was killed. This holiday (or rather a day of mourning) is widely celebrated in Shiite countries, in Morocco it is not an official day off and is celebrated among the people as a day of children who receive gifts and are photographed in improvised ateliers in beautiful national clothes.

Key events in the life of Moroccans are also celebrated in accordance with Muslim rites: birth, circumcision among boys, engagement and wedding, funerals. It is interesting that Morocco's current family code combines the Sharia principles with the "Western" ones. For example, polygamy is allowed, but only with the permission of the first wife and the existence of serious reasons that make it almost impossible.

## **Mosque**

![Hassan II mosque Morocco](/uploads/morocco-casablanca-mosque-man-prayer-islam-muslim-islamic.jpg "Hassan II mosque Morocco")

The mosque - the religious construction of Muslims, has always been the center of not only religious but also social life. The life of each residential quarter is concentrated around the mosque: shops, markets, cafes, hammams. The mosque itself is also a school and a center of charity.

The mosques in Morocco have their own characteristics. From the [**architectural**](/en/blog/moroccan-architecture/ "Moroccan Architecture") point of view, Moroccan (or North African in general) mosques tend to have only one minaret, and it is always rectangular, while in other countries of the Islamic world there are mosques with two, four and six minarets (in the Great Mosque of Mecca seven minarets), which can have different shapes and decorations. In Morocco, the minarets are decorated with carvings and arches, and the top of the minaret is crowned with battlements. The architecture of all mosques is characterized by the presence of mihrab(a richly decorated semicircular niche) in the front wall, which indicates the praying direction to Mecca.

For women in the mosque, a separate hall on the second floor or a part of the hall on the first, separated by a partition, is equipped. In Islam, women are encouraged to pray at home, while for men the visit to the mosque is mandatory, therefore the hall for women is always smaller in size than the male. Since the image of living beings is forbidden in Islam, mosques are decorated with calligraphic inscriptions from the Koran, ingenious geometric patterns-arabesques and floral motifs. In all the major mosques in Morocco, intended for Friday and festive prayers, there is a rectangular patio with a fountain for washing in the middle.

In Morocco, non-Muslims are prohibited from entering the mosque. This prohibition was introduced by Marshal Lyotte at the time of the French protectorate to distinguish between Muslims and non-Muslims and continues to this day. However, in Islam there was never a categorical ban on visiting mosques by non-Muslims. Tradition indicates that the Prophet himself allowed non-Muslims to enter the mosque in order to draw them to their faith. Today, most Muslim scholars (except for the Malikite school in Morocco) agree that non-Muslims can visit the mosque with the permission of Muslims and on condition that they respect the place of worship. It is interesting that in one mosque of the country - **the Mosque of Hasan II in** [**Casablanca**](/en/destinations/casablanca/ "Casablanca"), the entrance to non-Muslims is still allowed, but only for money and accompanied by a guide.

## **Sufism and popular Islam in Morocco**

![Muslim woman](/uploads/beautiful-woman-headscarf-arabic-veiled-islam-eyebrows-eyes-female.jpg "Muslim woman")

Practically in every territory where Islam came, it acquired local features, mixing with traditional beliefs and customs. In Morocco, these local features are especially evident in the cult of saints (banned by official Islam, who considers only one God to be worthy of worship), superstitions and magical rituals.

In Morocco, faith in the **jinn** is extremely strong (the spiritual beings existing parallel to the human world, according to the Quran). That is why visiting healers and witches, conducting rituals to expel or humiliate jinn, imposing or removing spoiling are an integral part of Moroccan life. To serve this industry of black and white magic, there was even a whole industry to supply it with magical ingredients. Some of them, such as herbs and roots, dried chameleon claws, wild animal teeth can be seen in Berber pharmacies, so beloved by tourists, and some, such as the brain of a hyena or the hand of a dead person, can only be found on the black market and for rabid money.

Morocco is one of the territories of widespread **Sufism** - the mystical teaching in Islam about approaching God and merging with him through ascetic practices and intuitive insights. The Sufis (from the Arabian "suf" - sackcloth, that is, the coarse wool garments worn by the first followers of the doctrine), are called ascetics, united in small sects-tariki, observing the canons of Islam stricter than others. "Official" Islam rejects many of the Sufi practices, such as asceticism, self-isolation from society, self-torture.

## **Islam and other religions in Morocco**

![sunrise praying](/uploads/sun-sky-sunrise-clouds-cloud-people-praying-islam.jpg "sunrise praying")

Islam was brought to Morocco by the Arab Umayyad dynasty from Damascus in the 7th century, but Christianity on its territory existed even earlier, during Roman rule. Throughout history, Christians and Jews could freely profess their religion and build churches and synagogues in Morocco. However, Islam always took a dominant position in comparison with them and had special rights.

Once in the medina of every city there were **Jewish quarters** (mella), but after the mass emigration of Jews from Morocco in the 20th century, a significant Jewish community survived today only in Casablanca.

## **Welcome to the Moroccan Muslim world**

![muslim architecture](/uploads/mosque-islam-religion-islamic-architecture-arabic.jpg "muslim architecture")

In Morocco, considered one of the most "open" countries of the Arab-Muslim world, the contradictions between the prescriptions of Islam and the influence of Western culture and way of life are especially strong.

Islam prescribes **women to wear hijab** : clothing that hides the entire body, except the face and hands. However, in the Moroccan law, hijab is not mandatory and a woman has the right to choose her own style of clothing. In fact, only about half of the Moroccan women support the wearing of the hijab, and it is not at all an indicator of a woman's religiousness.

Moroccan laws prohibit public manifestations of physical intimacy between a man and a woman. It is also forbidden for a man and a woman (if both or one of them is Moroccan), unmarried or close related, to stay in one hotel room or to live in the same apartment.

Islam categorically forbids Muslims to consume, but In Morocco, the situation with alcohol is very mixed. Officially, alcohol in the country is sold exclusively for foreigners, however, according to statistics, supermarkets, bars and discotheques of the country receive 99% of their profits from Moroccans. Morocco not only sells imported alcohol, but also produces its own (wine, beer). To date, Morocco is the largest producer of alcohol among Muslim countries. But during Ramadan and religious holidays, the sale of alcohol either completely ceases, or is carried out only by foreigners.
