If the hard nougat, the peladillas and the carols begin to generate a certain déjà vu sensation, I will give you some advice: try something different at this time. And if you have small children and you hesitate to go with them, today's entry about traveling with children to Morocco will clear them all. Let's start then!

## 5 Reasons to travel to Morocco with children

• **First, Moroccans love them**. Probably his defense of the figures of the child and the grandfather have a lot to do as fundamental points of the family (basis of every society worth his salt), and surely it is also related to his spontaneous looks and free of distrust, all of them values ​​that for misfortune in the West we begin to belittle. Be that as it may, a foreign child is a perfect candidate to awaken the fascination and sincere smile of a Moroccan.

• **Second, they help the older ones enjoy the trip more**. Unfortunately, when an adult travel to a country that he does not know and with marked cultural differences such as Morocco, he goes through an initial shock process in which he makes a conscious effort to understand another culture but, above all, to shake off prejudices. Fortunately, being accompanied by a child with an imperative need to interact with another culture through play and experimentation, makes us realize how ridiculous our attitude is and that we accelerate this process.

• **Third, they learn to disconnect**. I know I'm going to sound like a grandmother, but I see children more and more frequently manipulating their parents' tablet or phone. I am the first to believe that these contacts are necessary, because well used are an excellent tool for stimulation, play and education. But I think it abuses them and we can get to educate a very sedentary generation or, worse, that puts digital social networks to other forms of communication. So, traveling to a technologically less obsessed country can be a tremendously educational experience.

• **Fourth, it enriches them**. Traveling is an activity that allows us to expand our sights, especially in a country as different as Morocco; and with it, I do not only refer to the new range of sounds, flavors and smells that are presented. I think that, as we grow, we are acquiring simplistic visions of other cultures. This, unfortunately, is not solved by watching television or reading books: the only possible way to get rid of prejudices is traveling. Therefore, what better than subjecting our children to this experience from a very young age, and that the effort to understand other forms of life is not double that in the case of adults: forget what they have learned to learn it again.

• **Finally, in short, it is the best gift we can give them**. I think that everyone agrees that there is nothing better than enjoying money traveling the world; nor the most coveted object can cause a satisfaction like the adventure of a trip. For some reason, it is something that we assume but that, nevertheless, we are not able to see when we think about what to give to a child; as if the perfect candidate to tear a smile out of them was a toy.

## Some recommendations

While it is true that inviting the little ones to join us is an obviously positive decision, it is worthwhile to follow a series of indications so that the trip is as satisfying as possible for all. In addition to the initial suggestions, applicable to all members of the family and which I compiled in the post on advice before traveling to Morocco, there are a series of additional recommendations that I will summarize below:

When traveling to Morocco as a family you must consider a series of initial considerations:

• **About the documentation**. They need the same as an adult, that is, a valid passport with an expiration of more than six months.

• **About drinks and meals**. Being advisable in the case of adults, with children we should take precautions with drinks and stick to bottled water and natural milkshakes. Natural juices or other type of shakes would try to avoid them, since there is a probability that they will be adulterated with tap water to have more quantity.

And while Morocco is a stimulating discovery of new flavors, some may be reluctant to try dishes such as tagine or couscous. For this reason, restaurants usually have alternative dishes (pasta, pizza, chips, ...), which no child can resist; however, this option is not so common in hotel law firms. Better, therefore, hire a half board, which in addition to providing some comfort while you know restaurants (and avoid always go to the catering of the hotel that is usually repetitive), will give certain concessions to the little ones while discovering new flavors.

• **On health**, all cities of a minimum importance in Morocco have hospitals and clinics; Considering that private healthcare works better than public health. On the other hand, while it is true that in rural areas specialized medical attention will be more complicated (although it is rare for a place that does not have a small emergency center), denying them the experience of slipping through the dunes of the desert would be as ridiculous as oppose spending a family weekend in the mountains.

• **About specific items:** baby food, diapers, milk, etc. While they are not usual in stores, there is no problem to find them in large areas, Carrefour type and the like.

• **With regard to medication**, although in theory there should be no problem in supplying the one we need in local pharmacies, there may be problems with a more specific product, in addition to the added difficulty in understanding with the pharmacist. Therefore, to heal in health, it is better to take the usual medication from home.

• **About the itinerary.** Imagine if we are accompanied by children, whose patience is much less. Therefore, it’s practical to limit to visit an area (north, center or south), deepening more in each place and its surroundings.

• **About the activities**. Try to see through their eyes when you decide what to do in each city, although it is true that traveling through the medina is an exciting experience for them, because of the diversity of colors and smells of each stop, I think that spending too much time there It can get boring, as well as inside cultural buildings (palaces, museums, ...).

Better to combine it with other more fun activities for them, such as a small hiking trail or a ride on a dromedary or in a buggy. We can even kill two birds with one stone and combine leisure and education by committing to sustainable tourism, for example visiting women's cooperatives.

• **On the strollers and car**. My recommendation is to replace the usual stroller with a baby carrier or a light folding chair, in the case that the child already has a considerable weight, or we will have serious difficulties when walking through the medinas.

Now that you are aware of our tips, enjoy the beautiful tour with the family. It will be unforgettable to visit such a wonderful place with whom we love!
