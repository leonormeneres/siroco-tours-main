## **What about women's rights in Morocco?**

Morocco is considered progressive among the Arab countries. For example, it revolutionized marriage and divorce law in Morocco. The marriage age was - at least officially - raised to 18 years and women are now in the case of a divorce considerably better off. Nevertheless, domestic violence, child marriages and the poor education of women, especially in rural areas, are still a major problem.

**But how much does that say about the treatment of western tourists?**

You will find the Moroccans - both men and women - respectful, protective, helpful and extremely hospitable.

You will be possibly approached by men (and occasionally women) on the street and invited to mint tea. Without expectations or suggestive remarks - just to talk about God and the world. Most of them were curious about traveling alone, they wanted to know about life in Europe and what you think about Muslims.

One should keep in mind as a tourist that most Moroccans can never leave their country, as a Schengen visa is reserved only for high earners and all neighboring countries (Algeria, Mauritania) are in trouble with Morocco. Therefore, it is all the more understandable in less touristy areas that the locals like to contact foreigners - overcautious mistrust is often unnecessary.

**Of course, there were not just pink moments.**

At night, the streets can be scary, if you run across "wrong guides" and the chaos in the old towns can sometimes rob you of the nerve.

One thing you must deal with as a single woman: in many situations you will almost always be surrounded by men, be it in the café or at the bus station. Do not let that intimidate you!

We attach the following ten behavioral tips so that you can avoid unpleasant situations on your Morocco trip.

## **10 behavioral tips for women in Morocco**

### **1. Do not go crazy!**

![Moroccan woman walk through the souks](/uploads/womentravel6.jpg "Moroccan woman walk through the souks")

You should not travel to Morocco completely unprepared as a woman, but you do not have to go crazy for fear of doing something wrong.

Morocco is a touristically well-developed country and is considered one of the most liberal of all Arab countries. Besides, nobody expects you, as a foreigner and a non-Muslim, to master all the rules of conduct perfectly! Moroccans are lenient in this regard, so you should pass a faux pas - mäkäin muschkil (no problem)!

In preparation for your trip, you can also read some Morocco travel guide. There you can thoroughly inform yourself about sights, history, culture, and above all customs and traditions.

### **2. Dress yourself appropriately**

Knee-length trousers and the shoulders covered should be the least.

Unfortunately, especially in Marrakech you can see some tourists wearing hot pants and halter tops, but the heat is no excuse. Older Moroccan women wear their ankle-length cowl and headscarf at 40 ° C. Or you can travel to Morocco best in the winter - from November to February it is pleasant 20 ° C during the day.

In the rural area, the dress code is even stricter: here you should completely cover the leg and neck area.

### **3. Undercover with a headscarf**

A headscarf (hijab) is not expected by tourists. In the big cities, many young Moroccan women abstain from it.

Pashmina scarves are very suitable as headscarves, because they are nice and easy to grip. So that you do not look like you have a bird's nest on your head.

### **4. Learn important phrases in Arabic**

The official language in Morocco is Arabic. However, colloquial language is Moroccan Arabic (Darija), a dialect that is difficult for many Arabs to understand. The Moroccans are, so to speak, the Swiss among the Arabs.

Although Morocco has been independent of France since 1956, educated Moroccans still speak French as a second native language. French skills are extremely useful for a Morocco trip! On the north coast (Tangier, Tetouan, Ceuta), Spanish is the most widely understood foreign language. And if that were not enough, the actual mother tongue of about 50% of the Moroccans is Berber (Tamazigh ), so to speak the language of the natives of North Africa.

Nevertheless, it pays immensely to acquire a few phrases in Moroccan Arabic in order to communicate with less educated Moroccans.

Important phrases are "salam" (hello), "bislama" (bye), "barak allahu fik" (God protect you - is often said goodbye), "mziän bözaf" (very good), "smäh liyä" (sorry), "Created" (look!) And "atäy" (mint tea).

When rejecting any offer, in 95% of all cases, a friendly but definite "lä schukran" (no thanks). For emergencies you should have "Saafi" (enough), "Habess" (stop) and "Aunni" (help) at hand.

### **5. Use the buses from the CTM**

Buses are the cheapest and best-connected means of transportation in Morocco. Use whenever possible the buses of the company CTM.

Although other bus companies are sometimes cheaper by half (if you are not ripped off at the price), you can be sure of driving on a clean and modern bus with a fixed timetable.

### **6. Beware with faux guides**

Some Moroccans try to enrich tourists by addressing them on the street and offering them a friendly tour of the neighborhood or helping them find a hotel. In the end, however, the faux guide asks for a fee - then almost nobody can say no.

It could go not so well if they do not get what they expected. So, if you accept the invitation for a "free city tour", be aware that you will be asked for money at the end. Handle the fee before starting the tour to avoid unpleasant surprises.

### **7. Restraint in physical contact with men**

Between men and women, the only permitted body contact in public is shaking hands - the impulse must come from the man. Do it to your counterpart and put the hand on your heart after the handshake - a beautiful gesture that expresses respect and friendship!

### **8. Do not be stressed**

Maneuvering through the labyrinth of markets (souks) in Marrakech or Fes is a challenge: Crowds of people crowd from all sides, flying dealers push you with their carts aside, in between mopeds and donkeys are trying to make their way. Add to that the hypnotizing prayer songs and the shouts of the dealers…That can sometimes be too much!

If the impressions overwhelm you, then retire to a quieter shop for a few minutes and take a deep breath! Stay friendly to the dealers, even if you are asked to the hundredth time if you want to buy a scarf - to be bitchy and annoyed can backfire quickly!

### **9. Take care of the accommodation in advance**

This is not a problem in well-developed backpacking countries, but in Morocco it was rather uncomfortable if you do not take care of the accommodation in advance, because there are only a few accommodations in places, or in the dark it is even harder and more sinister to find them in the winding old towns. Then you must be willy-nilly brought by a faux guide for a tip to a hotel.

### **10. Avoid going out alone at night**

It is advisable to stay in the hotel after dark. On the one hand, conservative Moroccans believe that "good women" do not have to go out of their homes at night.
