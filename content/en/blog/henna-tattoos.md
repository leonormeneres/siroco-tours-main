The henna tattoos have become an alternative for those who do not want their skin to be pierced with needles or also do not want to have a permanent tattoo.

Henna comes from a plant called Alheña, its leaves after being dried and crushed have the property of dyeing. It is for its ability to color, which has been used since ancient times as a cosmetic product that allowed Chinese women to paint their nails, the Egyptians to paint mummies’ hair and the Assyrians to tattoo sacred symbols to benefit from magical protection.

In addition, henna is used in many villages in India and Africa to make convoluted ethnic designs that are very impressive and delicate, at the same time complex and ephemeral, since they only last two or three weeks depending on how many times the water reaches the tattooed place. The drawings are also used specially for rituals festivals for the community, such as weddings.

In addition, these tattoos are totally harmless, dyeing the skin in a red-orange color whose intensity varies depending on the type of skin, the location of the tattoo on the body and the time of exposure.

With only a few grams of dye you will see how it changes color, and although the black henna tattoo does not leave a much stronger mark than without dye, as it is a Non-permanent tattoo, they say it is true that sometimes the dye makes the drawing last longer.
