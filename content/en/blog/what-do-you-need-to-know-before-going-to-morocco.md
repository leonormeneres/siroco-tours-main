Morocco explicitly prohibits the import and export of Moroccan national currency dirhams. You can carry foreign currency freely to the country, but there are very strict restrictions on leaving the country, which is, carrying the equivalent of foreign currency with more than 50,000 dirhams must be held of the entry declaration.

Also, do not carry more than your own travel needs such as electrical appliances, clothing and other commodities into and out of the Moroccan border; the number of alcoholic beverages carried shall not exceed 1 bottle; two cartons of cigarettes; 150 ml of perfume.

### **What is the local currency? Are credit cards accepted?**

The Moroccan Dirham (MAD) is the local currency. Valley between 0.09 Euros and 0.11 Euros or from 0.10 and 0.125 USDs since about 2010. Generally, the dirham exchange rate is relatively constant, so there should be no surprises.

Remember that to withdraw money from an ATM in dirhams you will often be charged a foreign transaction fee of about 3 percent of your total ammount. Your transactions may be rejected due to a purchase limit abroad, so talk to your bank before leaving.

Most of the larger places accept credit cards, but the souks (open markets) and smaller shops prefer cash, especially if you want to negotiate something, money is still the king, and a good negotiating advantage!

### **What language do they speak?**

Moroccans speak a fascinating mix of Arabic and Berber, a language with more tradition in Morocco, but are also proficient in French (official language), Spanish and English.

### **What customs could cause me problems if I did not follow?**

Contrary to what is often suggested, Morocco has some freedom of customs, more in cities than in the villages, despite having a rigid family structure.

There are **three things** that Western culture allows a culture with Arab roots does not.

**The first** and perhaps the most surprising, is the use of the left hand to socially important tasks, such as eating. Never give a handshake using the left hand.

**The second difference is in women's clothes.** Morocco is hot in summer. You can wear your summer clothes, but in the central and southern mountains or the desert, where the local people are more conservative, both men and women should pay attention to how you dress. The best dress is a good breathable half-sleeve T-shirt with knee pants, ladies wear long skirt. If you enter the mosque to visit, ladies need to use the scarf to cover the hair, and wearing long sleeves, men also need long pants.

Winter climate is mild, the average temperature of 12 ℃ in January, but there is huge temperature difference in the morning and night of the mountain, desert area, need to wear a thick coat. Morocco has a strong uv exposure, so pay attention to sun screening. To enter the desert, you need to prepare a scarf to shelter the wind and sand.

**The third difference is the alcohol.** Moroccans are forbidden by the Muslim religion to drink alcohol, so offer them publicly alcohol is discouraged. However, in almost all tourist restaurants there is always a good wine list, and in cities such as Marrakesh, there are several bars where you can drink beer, wine and others. In our tours it is also possible to visit a wineyard near the city of Meknes but it is necessary to book before the beginning of the tour.

### **Should I buy travel insurance?**

Morocco is a safe and peaceful country, but it is always good to have access to benefits and be safe during your trip.

A Travel Insurance to Morocco is easy to buy and very cheap. You can do this process over the Internet. For example, here:

### **What kind of power converter do I need?**

You will need the European standard adapter.

### **Will my phone work there?**

Like many countries, it is often simpler to buy a cheap mobile phone, with an associated number, than using your number. To give an example, for about 5 Euros, you can get a phone, a local SIM card, and about one-week unlimited talk time for local calls. Today, with that same card, you can make 20 minutes of international calls for 2 Euros.

Alternatively, you can buy cards for use in telephone booths, which are also more economical.

### **Can I eat fresh fruits, vegetables and drink water?**

![moroccan food](/uploads/stew-1759394_1280.jpg "moroccan food")

Unlike Western countries that are moving quickly to packaged foods, even for commodities like fruits and vegetables, Morocco has production almost exclusively local. As a result, the choice will be less, but most will be brought to the table the way it would have been in the old days - quickly and without any processing. If you are concerned about the dirt on fresh produce, you can do what the locals do:

squeeze a good amount of lemon juice on it. In this way the food is safer, with a fresh and delicious taste. Anyway, note that not to eat products that spoil easily. As in most foreign countries, you should drink bottled water just to be safe. Avoid drinks with ice and take care with salads of raw vegetables.

**Enjoy the local cuisine** - which is one of the main reasons why visit this country!

### **To the Desert:**

You could wear cool clothes for the day, but if you travel before June or after October, don’t forget to bring a warm jacket for the night.

You should also take (or buy locally) a cotton scarf to make a "turban".

Before leaving on camels’ trip until the tent should bring 3 liters of water per person (mandatory, but our guide will provide this).

Do not forget the camera, but the highlight of the trip will be forever engraved in your memory... the silence... the stars... a milky way... the smell ... a magic!!!
