An inexpensive and fun way to travel around Morocco is the train. The rail carrier in Morocco is the state-owned company **ONCF** (Office National des Chemins de Fer du Maroc). The railway network connects all the important cities of the country: Marrakech, Fez, Tangier, Casablanca, Rabat, etc.

The [Supratours bus company](http://www.supratours.ma/) offers a combined train and bus service. So, if you travel to a place where the train does not arrive directly, you can buy through Supratours the train ticket combination that takes you to your destination directly.

## **Railway network in Morocco**

![train in Morocco](/uploads/moroccan_railways_electric_loco_hauled_train_at_tanger_ville_gare.jpg "train in Morocco")

The main network connects the cities of Tangier with Marrakech, in the north it branches to the city of Oujda while in the south another network leaves from Casablanca to El Jadida and Safi. It is composed of a network of fast trains (Casablanca - Rabat), another traditional and one in the south that combines the train with the bus – in the latter case, only one ticket is required.

The stations in all major cities are well equipped. There are cash desks, storage rooms, convenient and understandable timetables, information stands, waiting room and cafe. Arrivals and departures of trains are regularly announced in Arabic and French.

## **Schedule**

![railway](/uploads/railway5.jpg "railway")

The timetable and prices for all directions are on the [**ONCF website**](http://www.oncf.ma/), the national operator of the railway transport in Morocco. The site is in French, but it's not difficult to understand - you must choose the departure and arrival points from the drop-down menu. Tickets can be ordered online or purchased immediately before the train leaves at the ticket office of the train station. Places in the second class are not booked, only the train number and route are fixed.

## **Buying Tickets**

![railway station](/uploads/morocco_railway_station.jpg "railway station")

Trains in Morocco have several daily departures and are much cheaper than trains in Europe. The tickets can be bought just before boarding the train. Tickets are sold both at stations and directly on trains. Buying a ticket from the conductor, you will have to pay a commission of 10-20% of the cost (depends on the class of the train), so it is more practical to take a ticket in the ticket office at the station.

The train stations are usually located in the modern areas of the cities next to the bus stations to facilitate the change from one means of transport to the other.

Unfortunately, delays and late arrivals of trains are not uncommon, so it’s important to keep in mind and to lay a minimum of an hour for force majeure associated with transport.

## **Types of train tickets**

● **Couchette:** This is the most expensive ticket; however, it is also the most comfortable way to travel by train. Cabins with bunk beds and air conditioning. The Couchette is especially recommended if traveling long distances or traveling during the night.

● **First Class:** This is the most recommended way to travel in shorter journeys. The seats are comfortable and pre-assigned, and the wagons have air conditioning.
