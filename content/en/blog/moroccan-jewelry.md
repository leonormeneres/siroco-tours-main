Jewelry is an art form whose deep meaning can be traced back to the rich cultural history of its creators. Moroccan jewelry has a history that goes back to ancient times and is a byword for Moroccan craftsmanship. And perhaps the best part about accessories is that they go with all kinds of outfits. And believe it or not, wearing beautiful Moroccan jewelry makes you a more attractive person.

Moroccan jewelry are usually made of gold and silver, sometimes set with gemstone or semi-gemstone, made with ancient techniques, and these different styles have inspired the creation of berber jewelry. Moroccan jewelry has also suggested the wearer's geographic or tribal identity.

Moroccans love gold and silver, probably because the country is one of the world's top 20 silver producers and its mines have been used in the Souss-Massa-Draa area since the first century AD. Thanks to this resource, the town of Tiznit has grown into a major center for the production and sale of silver. The arrival of Islam in Morocco in the 7th century added a religious justification for the preference for silver, since some texts of the _Koran_ forbid the wearing of gold jewelry. As a result, silver is now Morocco's most popular choice.

## **Jewelry Tradition**

Traditionally, [berber](/en/blog/what-do-you-know-about-the-berber-people/ "What do you know about the Berber people?") women wore silver jewelry, especially heirlooms in marriage. At the time of marriage, berber women often got fine silver ornaments from their husbands that ensured that she had her own fortune in case of hardship or widowhood. One of the headdresses worn by all berber women at weddings is called Tasfift, which is essentially an ornate headdress decorated with silver or coins for King Mohammed V or Hassan II. It has a chicken on top, symbolizing fertility for the bride.

Gold is also a popular choice for modern Moroccan women because it is seen as a symbol of wealth. Berber men usually buy the jewelry for his wife, sister or mother, and when you see a berber piece, you can identify the berber tribe or certain parts of Morocco, and different pieces have spiritual meaning.
