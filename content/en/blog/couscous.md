Couscous is a food made from ground wheat semolina and kneaded so that small pellets remain that are cooked, normally, to the steam of the vegetables that later accompanied the plate.

For this purpose, a special vessel, is used so that, while the vegetables are cooked in the lower basin, the steam rises to the top that the couscous grains receive all their aroma.

Iconic dish of North Africa, rich in vegetables, semolina and various meats, couscous is at once balanced, festive and exotic. There are as many variations as regions of the Maghreb. It's up to you to opt for tradition or inventiveness to make your couscous a magical dish!

## **Couscous in Morocco**

Couscous is a dish that is eaten in many cultures, but it is undoubtedly well known as one of the gastronomic symbols of Morocco for its habitual consumption.

There are families who cook it once a day, but the real day in which the couscous becomes the protagonist, is Friday.

For the Moroccan Muslims, on Friday in addition to be the day of prayer (equivalent to Christian Sunday), it is a day to share a family lunch, which in the vast majority of houses, is a delicious dish of couscous with vegetables.

The couscous, in addition, is a symbol of hospitality, and a good opportunity to practice Sadaka -or charity-, that is why it is very common in many Moroccan towns, that your neighbor appears at home, on Friday at noon after the prayer time, to deliver a plate of couscous, or invite you to eat it with the family.

Couscous is also one of the main dishes of weddings, from the most ostentatious to the humblest, and unlike Fridays, it is usually cooked sweet, accompanied by raisins and chicken or lamb.

## **How to make couscous**

![Semolina and milk](/uploads/7.jpeg "Semolina and milk")

Balanced dish consisting of starchy foods (semolina of wheat or barley, chickpeas), a broth rich in vegetables and meat or fish, the couscous comes in many ways.

**Meat:** with grilled lamb, merguez or skewers, even dumplings made from beef or lamb, or even chicken (cooked in broth). 

**Fish:** couscous with conger and couscous with mullet are specialties of the seaside cities of Algeria and Tunisia. Dipped in saffron broth, fish cooked in perfect harmony with vegetables.

The meat will cook like a stew dipped directly in the sauce and vegetables, or will be cooked separately (grilled meat, dumplings ...). It perfumes in this way the broth and also the semolina, which cooks above the steam released by the stew.

**Vegetables:** depending on the season, the vegetables that make up the broth vary a lot. In winter, there are turnips, squash, carrots; in the spring, celery, peas, beans and even chard appear ... Chickpeas and tomatoes are present in every season and give the filling color and flavor.

Vegetables must be cut roughly, and especially of equal size, in order to have a time equivalent cooking. Make good sized pieces, to prevent them from being reduced to puree before the end of cooking. No broth without spices: paprika, cumin, coriander, 4 spices and ginger, not to mention a good amount of garlic, are essential!

**Sweet couscous:** garnished with dried fruits, oleaginous (pine nuts, almonds), scented with cinnamon and orange blossom.

**Couscous:** is prepared in a couscoussier, which consists of a large pot where the filling is cooked in the broth, and an upper part whose bottom is pierced to allow the passage of steam to cook the semolina which in this way delicately imbues the taste of the filling. To prevent it from getting through the holes, line it with a clean, slightly damp cloth.

There is also couscous made from barley and millet: nothing forbids you to try other cereals!

Finally, after a few hours cooking and a personal touch of seasoning, it will be ready to serve.

## **Enjoy**

The couscous is served in a large bowl or tray, pouring over with the desired vegetables, fruits or seasoning. The meat can be chopped on top, although the usual thing is to put it in the center, covered by the rest of the ingredients.

The preparation, cooking and presentation become an art, in which the real teachers are the women, usually those in charge of the kitchen, who delight the guests.

Since they begin to prepare the semolina and knead it to obtain the raw couscous, until it is cooked, simmered, and served, the process can take hours... so much so that a good couscous requires an entire morning to do real honor to your recipe, in the purest Moroccan style.

Sweet, salty, with meat or vegetarian, there are many different types of couscous. You can eat it with your hand or with the help of a spoon, but if you travel to Morocco you can not leave without trying at least once, this exquisite dish.
