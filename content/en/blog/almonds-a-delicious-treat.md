All the regions of Morocco celebrate almonds, from the Berber south where the famous amlou spread is prepared, to Fez, where several unmissable festive foods are from, like the succulent pigeon and almond pastilla, or the famous lamb tajine with prunes, beautifully decorated with almonds. But there is no need to wait for special occasions, almonds are the perfect ingredient to enjoy and share with others.

That much is clear from the delicious Moroccan traditional pastries mad from fragrant almond paste: gazelle horns, m’hanchas, kahks and other briouats.

### **The Bennis family in Casablanca, protecting traditions**

This famous house was founded in 1930 by Abderrahmane Bennis from Meknes. It was passed down to his daughter Mahjouba, then his grandson Omar, and it is now in the hands of Hakim Bennis, the 4th generation to watch over it. Since it was fouded, nothing has changed. It still uses the same discreet door tucked away in an alley of the Habous district. It is still in the same little room with zellige-covered walls, where nothing separates customers from employees.

The stalls still overflow with a variety of pastries, and above all the flavours are still the same, thanks to recipes using 100% natural ingredients: almonds, sugar, gum Arabic and orange blossom water. Everything is hand-made every morning, and then put in the public oven right in front from noon onwards. When the temperature of the oven starts to drop, the batches of pastries are replaced with pastillas and mechouis, which smell irresistible.

### **Maison Belkabir, between tradition and innovation**

In the shady alleys of Marrakech’s medina, it’s difficult to resist the pastries laid out on Haj Belkabir’s stand the regulars take by storm, specially during festivities. Representing the 3rd generation. Houda Belkabir wanted to pay tribute to her most refined and famous pastry: the gazelle horn. Just like macaroons, it can come in a flamboyant array of colors and flavors: esmerald-coloured pistachio, caramel with an amber tone, raspberry reminiscent of amethyst, yellow lemon, orange, cinnamon… Countless tasty treats.

The pastries are delicately placed in boxes that protect their fragile exterior. Indeed, Houda clearly remembers the lesson her father taught her: you can recognize a good gazelle horn by how fragile it is!

### **Maymana, exporting the Moroccan art of hospitality**

Maymana, which now has close to 300 emplyees, was founded over 30 years ago by five friends, including Naima Berrada, who adores Moroccan pastries and fights relentlessly for the emancipation of women.

This transgenerational and transcultural team exports gazelle horns from Tetouan, almond ghribas, honey briouats, and countless other symbols of Moroccan hospitality beyond its borders, since it even has shops in various airports in Morocco and in France. She has also collaborated with Moroccan designers in order to add original artistic touches to traditional patries.
