Although Tenerife organizes a lot of festivals throughout the year, none of them hold a candle to this carnival. The Carnival of Santa Cruz, considered to be the world’s second largest carnival after Rio’s (In Brazil), engulfs the capital of the Canary Islands in an extravagant atmosphere. The festival will be in full swing from February to March, with the key moment being the carnival queen selection.

Located at an altitude of 1.713m in the Middle Atlas, Ifrane is heaven for anyone passionate about gorgeous landscapes and cross-country skiing. Its nickname, Morocco’s “Little Switzerland”, fits perfectly with its pointy-roofed chalets, magnificent forest (the world’s largest cedar forest), lakes and waterfalls, maple and poplar forests and, of course, the abundance of snow during winter.

Upon discovering the vastness of the desert between Fezna and Goulmina, the artist Hanssjoerg Voth decided to build three gigantic architectural sculptures there: the Stairway to Heaven, the Gold Spiral and Orion’s City, the rectangular towers representing the main stars of Orion. All are made out of stone and cob, with ancestral techniques. A really wonderful place!
