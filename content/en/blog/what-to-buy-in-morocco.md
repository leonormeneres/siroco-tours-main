What a ubiquitous sensory experience! There are a lot of Moroccan specialties and traditional handicrafts. Let's take a look at some of the best souvenirs to buy in Morocco.

## **Pottery**

Exquisite ceramic crafts, such as dinner bowl, salad plate, bottle implement, tagine pot, are all good gifts for friends or family. The main ceramic centers in Morocco are Safi, Fes and Meknes. Both Marrakech and Essaouira have a wide range of souks, where you can buy ceramics for much less than you would at a tourist shop. Fes pottery is more elaborate, more detail-oriented and, of course, more expensive, while Safi is best known for its dark green ceramics. In Marrakech, you can find almost any type of pottery, including modernizations of traditional designs.

## **Carpets**

In Morocco, you will find two main types of carpets: urban carpets and berber carpets. Urban carpets traditionally made in and around the capital of Rabat are probably what most people think of as Moroccan carpets. They weave thick, intricate lace and are usually decorated with geometric patterns. The best cities to buy urban carpets are Rabat and Fes, and if you don't want to haggle, you can buy them in government-sponsored shops where prices are the same.

Berber carpets are made in the countryside by native berbers in Morocco. Each tribe and region has its own style. Traditionally, making carpets was a woman's job. As these carpets are often thinner than city carpets, they are usually hung on the wall as tapestries. One of the best places to buy Berber carpets throughout Morocco is in women's cooperatives, where a greater proportion of the profits go directly to the workers.

## **Leather goods**

Fes is the place to buy leather goods. In ancient medina, you can visit tanneries that process and dye leather in the traditional way. Go for a traditional pair of Moroccan slippers, a brightly colored purse or a stylish modern leather jacket. If you stay in Fes for a few days or longer, you can also customize leather products. Leather products range from unpolished leather bags and belts to unique babouches and ornate cushions. Some leather products are more like Italian designer luggage. If your trip takes you to southern Morocco, check out the tanneries and shops of Tarudant. In all cases you get what you pay for, so check the leather and the workmanship before you buy it.

## **Babouche**

Cute Moroccan slippers are made of leather. They are light and soft and suitable for hot summer days. You'll find them in all colors of the rainbow: all shades of red, pink and crimson, sapphire and navy blue, plain and ornate. It varies according to quality and store prices. Babouche is found in many shoe stores, luxury stores and outdoor markets. Our suggestion is to get them in the medina. Luxury stores often double the price, and regular shoe stores are often with poor quality made of plastic.

Buying local food as a gift is popular such as spices, nuts, herbs, olives and Moroccan desserts.

Moroccan cuisine uses many spices and herbs, such as saffron, ginger, paprika, cumin, turmeric, fennel seed, cinnamon, fenugreek, etc. All of these can be found in Moroccan spice markets, and are much cheaper than in western supermarkets. Zipper bags will help lock in flavor and freshness, but especially aromatic spices such as fennel and licorice should be individually packaged, otherwise the strong flavor will soak into other food. Of course, other preserved food and nuts are also great choices and are available at all major markets.

When flying from Morocco, you will always see travelers carrying the cookies in the bakery box, this is to ensure that the traditional dessert, such as kaab el ghazal, chebakia etc to be intact, but if you want to pack them in the luggage, many shops selling cheap plastic storage container, it also helps prevent vulnerable candy or pastry from being crushed.
