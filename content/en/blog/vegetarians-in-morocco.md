Eating and traveling are two things that work perfectly together. That is why, when we travel, we want to taste the local foods. Flavors and food styles talk a lot about a people's culture, as well as tasting food is always something delicious and necessary. The experience of tasting food from a place is part of getting to know it. Travel includes delighting in the flavors, proving them and from them further delineating the cultural definitions of that people.

When you are a vegetarian, dietary restrictions are normal and even customary. But they do not mean to fail to prove the tastes of the new places you visit: the tip is to look for the best recipes and restaurants for you.

As much as in Morocco there is no concept of vegan - alternatives to milk, tofu cheese, among others - Moroccans are extremely friendly and hospitable, make sure you feed yourself the best you can. So, the biggest advice you can give to someone going to Morocco is: let everyone know that you are a vegetarian, and they will find a way and serve something sensational. On the street, in the restaurant, where you go to sleep, talk about your eating options. Communicating is essential. They will tell you if they have meat or animal derivatives, as well as easily go after something for you to eat.

In Moroccan streets, there are so-called magasins, Moroccan-style convenience stores that exist on all sides. All cities, towns and villages have. In these stores, everything is available, especially if you like to venture out and try exocyticides. It is possible to buy juices, almonds, dates, fruits, water, juices and teas in general. The quantity and variety of products is sensational.

You should already know, from other texts, that Moroccans love serving tea, which is a mixture of black tea with mint. There are always several houses of teas and sweets - they also have a very sweet palate, even in tea they add sugar. It is worth remembering, on the sweets, that many carry honey. But you still have the pistachio and almonds, for example. Always delicious.

For simple food such as couscous with vegetables, it is easier to find and especially in Morocco, they have already understood that they have many vegetarian tourists. In more elaborate restaurants, or to taste the famous tajine, it can be difficult, because this dish is cooked in the oven for a long time, and they usually prepare in the afternoon. You can not improvise.

The option that many choose is to ask the cook to make a new tajine for you, that is, to cut all the vegetables. Some even accept that you help yourself, cut the vegetables, wash everything. At startup they may be suspicious, but everything with a smile works, and they end up being all glad to have a foreigner to cook there in the restaurant.

If you want a quick snack, you will always be able to go buy something. At a time when you are hungry and want to eat well, simply go to a store and buy a can of beans, bread, olives, and cheese and ready, a meal made, protein and cheap. It is quite possible to eat well within what you think is best.

To be more specific, a beautiful restaurant tip is called **Dar Tajine**, and although they serve meat, the owner specializes in vegetarian dishes.

It is customarily praised by those who visit. At certain times, though not at lunchtime, you can sample the local soup. There are fruits and biscuits from the region, all made with fresh products, all great for you to taste in a simple but complete, all the flavors of the region.

About the history of the place, says the owner that his mother worked as cook for the King and she who taught him to cook. Whether the story is true or not, we do not know. But the food is indeed divine. It is in Fes and it is very easy to get lost in the medina. This restaurant is especially difficult to find and the owner knows this, so he recommends that they call and he sends his son to show the way. The seats are close, a 15 minute walk, but without knowing the way and even more at night, you might end up not finding and missing out on great tastes.
