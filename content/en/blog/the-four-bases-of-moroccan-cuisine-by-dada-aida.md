Dada Aida joined the Maison Arabe in Marrakech 20 years ago now, in order to run the kitchens of this Moroccan restaurant. There she practices the knowledge she acquired from her grandmother, who used to be the “dada” (governess) of Jacques Majorelle, the late French Orientalist painter who settled in the Ocher city. She has been giving cooking classes for 8 years and is delighted to see how diligently the visitors, who come from all over the world, follow her every step. But when you ask her what the real secret to her delicious cooking is, she shows off her hands with a knowing smile. “The skill is passed down from mother and grand-mother to daughter and is developed with a great deal of practice”, added this talented queen of stove.

Mchermel mainly refers to cooking fish. But nowadays, it can also be applied to chicken or meat. For the marinade, you need to mix olive oil, onions, fresh herbs (parsley and coriander), lemon, preserved lemon, garlic, a good amount of ginger, paprika, saffron, cumin, salt and pepper. Once you have finished cooking, you can also add olives.

### · **Mhammer ou roti**

Firstly, the meat is seared with onions, garlic, preserved lemon, lemon juice (optional), fresh herbs (parsley and coriander), smen (optional), oil (olive oil or salad oil, or both) as well as the following spices: ginger, paprika, saffron, turmeric… Once the meat has been well seared, add water to tenderise the meat. Once it is almost cooked, add the desired side (vegetables of your choosing). If the side is sweet (prunes, dates, apricots…), you can add cinnamon.

What’s specific about this cooking technique is that it doesn’t produce much sauce. The meat is cooked by browning it over a medium heat. To the onions, garlic and oil (a mixture of olive and salad oil) and to the preserved lemons, add the following spices: saffron, turmeric, ginger, coriander, salt, pepper and paprika… Meat cooked in this way can be served with sautéed vegetables and even decorated with shelled and fried almonds.

### · **Kadra**

This cooking process, originally from Fez, also referred to as “kadra fassia”, involves adding blanched, shelled almonds or chickpeas to the meat. You begin cooking with onions, smen (optional) and oil (ideally a mixture of salad and olive oil), to wich you add saffron, ginger, pepper and salt, and possibly also a cinnamon stick. Garlic is not added, unless it involves young cockerels, but then only a tiny amount. Chickpeas are added at the beginning of the cooking process so that they cook properly. Almonds are only added when the meat is almost done. Just before serving, sprinkle over with some finely sliced and lightly cooked onions.

### · **Ras el Hanout**

In Morocco, every Family, and every shop has their own secret recipe for making this exotic spice mix, the name of which literally means “head of the shop”, and it is made up of 30 or even 50 ingredients. For most recipes, cinnamon, chilli, coriander, cumin, nutmeg, peppercorns, cardamom and cloves are used. It is rubbed into meat and used in tajines. It spices up vegetables and rice delightfully.
