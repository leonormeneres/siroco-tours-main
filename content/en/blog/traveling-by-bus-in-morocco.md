Buses in Morocco are one of the most popular ways of traveling around the country. Although the railway connects almost all corners of the kingdom, sometimes there is reason to choose a long-distance bus. The blessing in every Moroccan village is the bus station.

There are good bus connections between major cities, mainly private buses. The two largest companies are [**CTM**](http://www.ctm.ma/en) and [**Supratours**](http://www.supratours.ma/en/). Buses between most major cities and villages are frequent and regular.

## **Buses in Morocco**

![City bus](/uploads/alsa_city_bus_mercedes_midi_bus_marrakech_medina.jpg "City bus")

The prices of bus tickets in Morocco vary according to the distance, between 20 and 250DH (between € 1.73 and 22), plus 7 DH approximately for each suitcase, depending on the weight.

For example, from Tangier to Casablanca, the trip on the intercity bus costs 80 dirhams (about 8 US dollars), while the train ticket costs 135DH.

The savings are substantial, but it is very likely that the trip will be delayed and you must always consider unforeseen adventures on the road. **So, it is the cheapest but also the slowest and uncomfortable**. The trip can become a torture, because there is little space between the seats and, if you can find a free site, the bus will often be stopped during the trip, because something can break on the road, or the bus for some reason will be delayed by traffic police. Do not be surprised if the driver does not have a driving license. This is Morocco, here its rules.

Nevertheless, even if such a situation happens, after a quarter of an hour the bus moves on.

It is advisable to get on the bus early to get a seat. It is customary to tip the conductor for baggage loading.

## **Bus stations**

The bus stations are different everywhere. In large cities, they are more notable. But in small towns it can be just a patch near the road without any identification marks.

Do not really rely on the schedule, better listen. The barkers of bus companies loudly shout out populated places where they stop. Hearing your direction, go to the right person, he will take you to the bus. The driver or his assistant in exchange for money will give a crumpled piece of paper with Arabic characters. It's a ticket. For the sake of faithfulness, he can inflate the fare on it with a pen. Now wait. The bus leaves after it has collected enough passengers. Taking the ticket at least 24 hours before to secure the seat on the bus is also recommended.

## **Two Major bus companies**

### · **Supratours buses**

Supratours is part of the Moroccan railway company (ONCF) and the buses run as a supplement to the rail network. Their buses are comparatively modern and even have free Wi-Fi.

You can see the **timetables** on the website at [**Supratours**](http://www.supratours.ma/en/). Also, on the train page at [ONCF](http://www.oncf.ma), the Supratours connections can be found.

**Tickets** for Supratours and the train are available online (with local bank card), otherwise you can buy them at the departure point. On popular routes (and times) It’s better to get the tickets one to two days in advance.

For the **transport of suitcases**, you need to buy an extra suitcase ticket from Supratours . For example, the route Marrakech - Essaouira is 10 MAD per suitcase.

### · **CTM buses**

You can also travel long distances by bus from [**CTM**](http://www.ctm.ma/en). It has one of the largest and most modern vehicle fleets. These are one of the most comfortable to travel, although it is also somewhat more expensive than the other companies.

In all cities will find the bus station or Gare Routier, where you can buy your **tickets** to travel throughout Morocco. CTM used the same buses as Supratours, but CTM buses sometimes are not in as good shape as the competitors. The seats can be a bit shaky, but bearable.

It also requires an **extra suitcase ticket** as Supratours.

There are also other buses in Morocco for tourists, with air conditioning and TV service. The private companies SATAS, Flandria and Trans Ghazala have very comfortable buses, with wide coverage and good prices.

## **Other bus companies**

In addition to the named "big ones", there are a multitude of smaller bus companies that also connect big cities. Tickets for these companies you get directly at the major bus stations. The tickets are usually cheaper, but the comfort is not necessarily given.

CTM and Supratours buses geared to the development of tourist infrastructure, they offer better comfort than local buses between cities, which are cheaper, crowded, slower, but where you have the chance to meet local people and perhaps their hens.

If you prefer reliability and comfort choose a Supratours or CTM bus, but if you like the adventures, a local bus is just right for you.

## **Tips**

• During the day the sun is merciless in Morocco. Although there are curtains in the buses, these only keep the sunbeams to a limited extent. So be prepared! And If you ask nicely, with luck you will get a place on the shady side.

• On all longer trips, there is at least one obligatory stop that lasts less than half an hour, so you have enough time to eat or to stretch your legs.
