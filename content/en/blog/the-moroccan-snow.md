You may be wondering why this is so little mentioned. As so often happens in countries with a certain dimension, reality goes beyond culturally created stereotypes. Morocco is known for sun, colors and warmth, but the truth is that there are ski resorts in Morocco, as there are in Turkey or Iran. To be more exact, Morocco is on the list of the only three African countries - the other Lesotho and South Africa - where you can ski. For its radiant beauties, it is especially popular among tourists who know the favorable regions.

One sign of this incredible truth is the presence of Morocco at the Winter Olympics. In its 2018 edition, which took place in South Korea, Morocco featured two athletes, one in the form of downhill skiing and the other in cross-country skiing.

### **Know Ifrane**

![Building with red roof](/uploads/1200px-Azrou,college.jpg "Building with red roof")

Ifrane is best known for being the ski town. Call in Morocco as the Moroccan Switzerland because of the sport, the cooler climate, the gardens and chalets of red roofs. The city is 1650 meters high, and given that, during the winter is all covered with snow, which attracts many tourists to the ski resort Michliffen. Ifrane is undoubtedly very charming, pleasant and quiet.

It is easy to reach Ifrane, unlike other places suitable for skiing in Morocco, it is possible to arrive by bus. The city lies in the heart of the Middle Atlas Mountains, and the road to it is already delicious: from Fez to Marrakech, you will pass through several towns and villages that deserve to be mentioned, with beautiful landscapes. The first town is soon Ifrane, which is about an hour from Fez. It is the ideal place to travel and get acquainted with the holidays and holidays of the Moroccans. The many houses there are not usually inhabited - they are only for the holidays, whether for skiing or during the summer. The owner families are from [Casablanca](/en/destinations/casablanca/ "Casablanca"), [Agadir](/en/destinations/agadir/ "Agadir"), [Tangier](/en/destinations/tangier/ "Tangier") or from European countries.

This beautiful architecture, so comfortable, has a lot to talk about. It is organized and modern, built during the period of domination over Morocco, in an attempt to create a city that would resemble the ski resorts of the French Alps.

The famous Ifrane roofs accompany its history. Its name means cavern, or caves, place where the barbarian tribes inhabited. The city was created in 1929 by the French protectorate. Its fame made the city deserve to be a site for the construction of another royal palace, with flashy roofs, according to tradition. As a curiosity, it is worth mentioning that this palace does not speak the English language.

Ifrane has many gardens, restaurants, hotels and houses one of the most important universities in Morocco, Al-Akhawayn, which, despite the alpine climate, gives it a golden age always young and current.

Because of its history, Ifrane possesses this Alpine atmosphere, explainable by the French influence, since most of the constructions that are here date back to the time of the French Protectorate. The ski resort was built in the 50's, remaining virtually unchanged.

Because of its climate so cold, not only ifaver lives in winter. The city became a tourist destination also in the summer, as residents of nearby cities such as Fez, Meknes and El Hajeb, or other hot spots in the world, travel there to escape the strong heat in July and August. On the outskirts of the city there are three protected natural areas: the Ifrane National Park, the northwest, the Cedros Forest to the south and the Ifrane Game Reserve to the northeast.

Although Oukaimeden is the only true ski resort in Morocco, Ifrane may have a lot to offer the sport lover. It is located in the Atlas, about 65 km south of Meknes and Fez. It is known for the Michlifen ski resort, which is the second most popular point in the country for skiing, following to Oukaimeden. Due to the high altitude, snow is abundant in winter and has a cool summer weather. In Ifrane the lowest temperature in Africa was recorded: -23 ° C in 1935.

Here we find some accessible slopes, suitable for beginners and intermediate skiers, served by an elevator. If you prefer the natural air, you can simply walk to the top. The slopes are short, but there are still those who want to do some skiing in a country as unlikely as Morocco and for those who visit the back country this is the best place to practice winter sports. Those who cannot bring their own equipment, always have the option of renting either at the station of Michlifen or in the village of Ifrane.
