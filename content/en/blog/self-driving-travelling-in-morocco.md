Morocco **has greatly improved its infrastructure in recent years**. Proof of this is that there are already many people who decide to spend their holidays in this country in a rented car (and even in their own car) that allows them to travel around the cities with a little more freedom. A few years ago, this was only allowed for off-road vehicles, but, at present, it is possible to travel with conventional cars in almost all parts of the country.

## **Papers required:**

However, whoever decides on this option must be very clear that traveling through the country is not as simple as it can be in Europe or other western countries. The first problem is the way to get the car if you decide to make the trip with your own vehicle: in this case you must buy a ticket for the boat and make sure you have all the papers in order:

* international driver's license;
* if the car is not in your name, a paper signed by the owner authorizing you to use it;
* international insurance.

## **Pay attention**

Once you have started up, you must bear in mind that **traffic signs are written in Arabic and French** and that the basic rules of circulation in Europe (stops, lanes, overtaking, etc.) are the same in this country. In addition, it is mandatory to use the seat belt on all routes and, and as an extra rule, you must be very attentive to pedestrians, bicycles, motorcycles without lights and animals with loads, since, sometimes, it is difficult to see them and can be very dangerous.

It must also be borne in mind that **the driving of Moroccans is often very aggressive**, often roaming the legality (not always respect the signage and traffic lights), so you must be very cautious at the wheel. However, they do **tend to be very collaborative** and most of them happily help a lost alien or with a mechanical problem.

### **Speed**

**Regarding speed**, the maximum limits are 120 kilometers per hour on highways and between 40 and 60 kilometers per hour in cities. Logically, these limits may vary so you must be very attentive to the signs, as the Moroccan police is very fond of setting speed tickets, especially if they find the endorsement of one of the **many mobile radars** that is working. Even so, if they consider that the vehicle passed only for one kilometer per hour more than allowed, the fine will be effective.

At present **there are seven highways** that cover a good part of the country, although the construction of more is already planned. So, you can go comfortably between the following cities:

* Casablanca-Kenitra-Tangier (A1)
* Rabat-Fez-Oujda (A2)
* Casablanca-Rabat (A3)
* Tangier- Tangier port (A4)
* Casablanca-Safi (A5)
* Tetu√°n- Fnideq (A6)
* Casablanca-Agadir (A7)

Those who love history can have an indispensable journey on the " _route of unity_ ". This road was **the first major public work** that was built in the country after independence and that, in 1957, united Ketama and Taounate. The road was very important for transport, but it **has** also **been considered a symbol as a reflection of the changes**.

### **Fuel**

Also, you must take fuel into account. In the cities there will be no problems to fill the tank but, in many areas of the interior of the country, **gas stations are scarce,** and you can see yourselves with an empty warehouse in the middle of nowhere.

Regarding **road controls,** they are much less frequent than in the past, but they still do, especially in the border areas and in the south of the country.

There is no doubt that in the last 10 years Moroccan roads have improved a lot, not only in quality but also in quantity. However, self-driving can be stressful and unpredictable if you travel to the country for the first time or do not quite know the country. Therefore, it is **advisable** to get a friendly driver or guide who know the country extremely well and who can take you to anywhere you want, explore the Sahara off-road, help you to discover the hidden treasure, the secret oases that only those who were born and raised there know of this wonderful country.
