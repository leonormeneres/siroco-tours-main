## **Sahara Desert**

![Huge Sahara dunes](/uploads/1586662335908.jpg "Huge Sahara dunes")

Perhaps the first thing that comes to mind when mentioning Africa is the desert. Sahara is a great natural attraction of Morocco. In the Arabian language, the desert sounds like "sugar".

The desert extends from the Red Sea to the Atlantic and has an area of ​​more than 8 million km2! The desert is an amazing natural landscape with endless barkhans (crescent-shaped dune) and "islets" of juicy oases.

Sahara is rich not only in traditional desert landscapes, - the landscape is also represented by huge sand dunes, volcanic formations, highlands and salt marshes. And empty sandy areas in the whole of the Sahara are only 25% of the total area. Even though the Sahara lies across the borders of 11 states, it is easier to visit it through Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco.

However, the most charming beauty of the desert is not easily accessible, as they lie in countries that tourists do not want to come to, because of the complex political situation - Algeria, Libya, Chad and Niger.

The most convenient part of the Sahara is located just in the southeast of Morocco, at the foot of the High Atlas Mountains. It is in this part the famous natural landmark - the [Draa Valley](/en/destinations/the-draa-valley/ "Draa Valley"). It is home to luscious oases, red dunes, exotic fortresses, fortified kasbahs with settlements of the indigenous people of Morocco, [the Berbers](/en/blog/what-do-you-know-about-the-berber-people/ "What do you know about the Berber people? ").

![Ruins of a luxurious structure of EL-Badi palace](/uploads/1586662551904.jpg "Ruins of a luxurious structure of EL-Badi palace")

The palace of the great sultan Al-Badi today is just the ruins of a luxurious structure, whose scale and magnificence resemble only ancient massive walls.

There are several versions of what became the prototype of this wonderful building. One of them says that the main source of the El-Badi palace is the Alhambra Palace in Granada. In the El-Badi palace there were about 360 different rooms, a huge swimming pool measuring 90 by 20 meters and a huge courtyard with gardens of orange trees.

![The great ancient wall of the palace](/uploads/1586666972514.jpg "The great ancient wall of the palace")

The rich filling and decoration of the palace in the past are gold, crystal, turquoise, precious wood and Irish granite, now only history remains.

In 1683 the Sultan Ismail Mulai decided to move the capital to the town of Meknes and build a new large palace. He ordered to dismantle the El-Badi palace to build his new palace. Most of the treasures of the El-Badi palace and precious finishing materials were transported to the palace of the Sultan Ismail Mulai.

Now tourists can see on the territory of the palace only massive walls. Almost throughout the palace there is an opportunity to see the windows of the dungeons where servants lived. In addition, you can see the ancient palace arches and the remains of ancient baths.
