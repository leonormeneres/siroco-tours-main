Morocco is a diverse mosaic of peoples and cultures because of its history. This led Morocco to bring to Berber support both the Saharan and Sub-Saharan African rhythm, the Greco-Roman, Phoenician and African rituals, the Arab culture without omitting the Andalusian refinement.

The Moroccans have rhythm in the blood. Wherever they are in, a taxi, the market or at home, they make music tapping on their heads, knocking their shoes on the pavement, tinkering on the coins, knocking the inverted pot, getting rid of the worry and pulsating the blood. Rhythm is the soul of culture as in many African countries.

The music in Morocco is very diverse and consists of several major groups or families of music. Each group is itself made up of subgroups. Thus, Arab music in Morocco is composed of modern Arabic music influenced by contemporary Arabic music from the rest of the Arab world.

Arab music from the region (Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, etc.) specific to each region of Morocco, usually sung the "classical" Arab-Andalusian music in Arabic dialect of each region, music itself composed of subgroups of Fez, Rabat, Tetouan, Oujda (gharnati) and the cradle of music Aarfa which is the source of several musics like Reggada, Allaoui, nâari. There is also raï located in the Oujda region near the Algerian border.

## **Arab-Andalusian music**

![Musician with traditional instrument](/uploads/4-11.jpg "Musician with traditional instrument")

Arab-Andalusian music is divided into sub-groups depending on the Andalusian cities of origin of the refugees settled in Spanish-Andalusian Morocco: Meknes, Fez, Rabat, Salé, Tangier, Tetouan, Oujda, Chefchaouen: it can be sung in Arabic cult or colloquial even occasionally in Spanish and Hebrew.

Andalusian music migrated to North Africa in the 16th century and settled with their stability in the Islamic Maghreb. Although many scholars return to their roots in the Arab Orient because of their poetry and spiritual character, it is a special music that grew in soil mixed with the Arab-Islamic culture and Iberian culture.

The lyrics of Andalusian music are composed of poetry, muwashshah and zajal, which combine sermons, jokes, praise of all kinds.

The Andalusian music is originally composed of several musical suites called nûba , which are said to exist 24, one for each hour of the day and each different from each other and associated with a certain emotion or situation, but there are only 11 left in Morocco today.

## **Berber music**

![Berber music in desert](/uploads/8-5.jpg "Berber music in desert")

**Amazigh music (Berber)** is also divided into subgroups, usually according to the various regions.

The Atlas forms a mountainous ridge which begins in the North at the height of Fez and extends towards the south until the height of Goulimine.

In these regions, where humans live at the rhythm of **nature and cultivation**, music can not be limited to a simple sound production. Indeed, it acts on nature and people, provokes winds and storms, breathes the divine breath to cultures that are dying or that are likely to disappear, as well as to nature that is drying up, in an environment where one of the concerns of the inhabitants are the good growth of cereals. Thus, the music will be outlawed at times or on the contrary intensified at other times of the year. It is this link with nature that makes any general vision of the Atlas music so difficult. They are indeed attached in each community to the functioning of **social and agricultural life**.

If the difference between Arabic music and Berber music can seem very pronounced, it is probably because of the very strong preponderance in some big cities of Arab-Andalusian music to the detriment of the less known popular Arab music. Admittedly, Arabic and Berber music have significant individual characters if you see from the instrumental points of view (indeed, string instruments are not present in the Atlas and reserved for professional musicians) and choreographic (Berber music is strongly anchored in the dance).

## **The Gnaouas (or Gnâwas)**

![Gnawa music festival](/uploads/9-6.jpg "Gnawa music festival")

Gnawa is specific to the region of Marrakech, Essaouira and southern Morocco, the lyrics are either in Arabic, Amazigh or an African-Arab mix.

The Gnawas are mostly descendants of African slaves (from sub-Saharan countries: Senegal, Sudan, Mali, Nigeria, Guinea or Ghana, from which the term "Gnawa" derives), who arrived in Morocco from the 12th century onwards. century to strengthen the armies of warriors and participate in the construction of Almohad palaces.

Once settled in Morocco, the Gnawas formed brotherhoods around master musicians (called "mâalems"), traditional musicians, clairvoyants and healers. To enter the brotherhood, the members are initiated during a syncretic rite of possession that combines African, Arab and Berber contributions during which they indulge in trances and dances of possession.

Gnawa music is above all a **spiritual music**, with wild rhythms, accompanied by the sound of typical instruments: qraqeb (big metal rattlesnakes), tbels (big drums), guembri (kind of rectangular lute in camel skin with three strings). This music tells the story of the slave past of the Gnawas, their daily life, their past sufferings. With their conversion to Islam, the Gnawas have incorporated evocations of the Prophet Muhammad into their music. The Gnawas also worship Sidna Bilal, a black slave converted to Islam and freed by Mohammed after healing his daughter by music.

**Gnawas musicians** perform at nocturnal ceremonies called "lila" in Morocco (night in Arabic) during which they perform their rites of possession for therapeutic purposes ("derdeba") to exorcise patients. During these ceremonies, seers go into a trance to the sound of Gnaoua music. This ceremony, which lasts from sunset to dawn, feeds superstitions on the occult power of seers and Gnawa musicians.

Gnawa music is honored every year in Essaouira at the **Gnawa International Music Festival**. The artistic exchanges between Morocco and the West have allowed the diffusion of this musical style, which is today incorporated in modern compositions (jazz-gnaoua fusion, blues-gnaoua, reggae-gnaoua, Moroccan rap).

## **Chaabi**

Chaabi is a music that consists of numerous varieties that have descended from the multifarious forms of Moroccan folk music. Chaabi was originally made in the markets but is now found at any celebration.

Chaabi mixes the Oriental instruments of the Arab-Andalusian classic with others from the Western classic. There is the darbuka (percussion) and the tambourine, but also the mandole (a kind of big mandolin with guitar sounds, equipped with four double metal strings), the violin and oddly the banjo, not forgetting the piano. Algiers is famous for its pianists and accordionists. Chaabi players always use their violin vertically as they used to handle the gimbri.

Unlike the rai, born in Oran. Chaâbi songs, carried by the Algerian or Berber idiom, feed on ancient poetry but also the echo of heritage. According to the musician and ukulele player Cyril Lefebvre, "people attack hard, express themselves violently, which in some respects brings the chaabi of the blues". Chaabi will, for sure, break the house!

## **The Samâa: Sacred Songs**

![Morocco traditional scared songs player](/uploads/15.jpg "Morocco traditional scared songs player")

The Samâa is an art of sacred songs, hymns to the prophet Mohamed and to Allah, which occurs during religious festivals (mosques, mausoleums) or even weddings, burials, births or circumcisions.

The evening of Samâa is ritual. It begins with fumigation sessions with sandal wood and reading the Fatiha (first Surah of the Quran) under the sign of serenity and purification.

This practice dates back to the advent of Islam in 622 (AD) and the Prophe was received during his exodus from Mecca to Medina by a song to his glory which is up to this day sung in all Arab countries ("The moon throne among us" or Talaâ el Badrou aleyna).

Samâa's group usually consists of 8 to 40 people, who were initiated and trained to these songs in brotherhoods.

## **Rai**

Rai is another musical genre that rocks its roots in Algeria, which became popular in the 1960s today, exercising a major influence on Moroccan music. Joining elements of jazz, hip-hop and rap with modern electric instruments creates special sounds that come out of the Moroccan border (Khaled is one of the most famous interpreters). The music tends to enter the traditional Maghreb music to western styles. Currently musicians combine the Moroccan tradition with western souls, creating a pulsating and hypnotic industrial sound.

## **New generation**

Finally, there is a new generation of young people, who creates a music that synthesizes the Moroccan spirit influences from around the world (blues, rock, metal, reggae, Moroccan rap, etc.). One of the most important events of this "underground" scene is the Boulevard des Jeunes Musicians, which takes place every year in Casablanca and brings together Moroccan youth in the same cultural event.

You will love to enjoy the beauty of the varied Moroccan rhythms in trendy nights, clubs, restaurants with live music or at electrifying festivals. Take advantage of the cheerful and colorful spirit of Morocco to be completely immersed in the culture of so much history, music and dance.
