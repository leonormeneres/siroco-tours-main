#### **Important Note:**

When booking flights, make sure that your pet can fly in the cabin with you. Like the Royal Air Maroc, you must indicate that you wish to travel with your pet at the time of booking. The fact is that there is a rule regulating the number of animals in the cabin, most often, four places for the flight. So, you should immediately **call the airline reservation service** and reserve a place for your animal, while the limit is not exceeded. Otherwise, he will be offered to fly in the luggage compartment.

The weight of the animal should not exceed 8 kg together with the container (be sure to check the dimensions of the carrying - the parameters must meet the requirements of the specific airline).

Also note that guide dogs, rescue dogs are accepted free in the cabin regardless of their size. You will still need to present a medical certificate attesting to the disability of the passenger.
