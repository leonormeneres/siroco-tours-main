The presence of Jews in Morocco dates back many centuries and there are even those who refer to the first century B.C. Its millennial saga begins with the establishment of the Jews even while reigning over Israel. In the time of King Solomon, many Jews worked as merchants and in the gold business. Some of them would have settled in the Moroccan Sahara.

Although the lack of documents does not allow for accuracy, evidence has shown that the early Jews gained their presence from the First Temple, with confirmation only at the time of the destruction of the Second Time – 70 B.C.

Later, Morocco was also home to countless Jews who were expelled from Spain in the fifteenth century by the Catholic kings. In 1948 the Moroccan Jewish community was the largest in North Africa, with about 265,000 people, or 10% of the local population.

## **∙ Tangier – Chefchaouen**

![The Jewish literature](/uploads/1280px-thumbnail.jpg "The Jewish literature")

[Tangier](/en/destinations/tangier/ "Tangier") has a long Jewish history. Not just Jewish - throughout history, Tangier has been a multicultural enclave of Muslim, Jewish and Christian communities. 

There are records of Jews inhabiting the city after the destruction of the first temple. A second wave of Jews into the city came in the 5th and 6th century, with the Jews fleeing the Visigoths that have just invaded Iberia. Later, with the expulsion of the safaris from the Iberia, a new wave of Jews arrived into the city. Today it is possible to visit the synagogue and the old Jewish quarters with a private local historical guide which will show you and explain to you the most relevant places.

You can visit the [museum in Tangier](/en/destinations/museum-kasbah-of-the-mediterranean-cultures-of-tangier/ "Museum Kasbah of the Mediterranean cultures of Tangier"), where Jewish artifacts can be found, such as an old Torah. Then we go to [Chefchaouen.](/en/destinations/chefchaouen/ "Chefchaouen") To arrive at Chefchaouen is to immerse yourself in a labyrinth that unlike other Moroccan medinas, has a perfect order and harmony. All roads lead to Hamman Square, where it is the largest mosque and meeting center of its inhabitants.

![Blue city-Chefchaouen](/uploads/Chefchaouen1.jpg "Blue city-Chefchaouen")

Originally, Chefchaouen was populated primarily by al-Andalus exiles, both Muslim and Jewish, who quickly made it thrive. It became known as one of the main places where the Moors and Iberian Jews sought refuge.

In addition to the Jewish buildings of narrow streets, uneven layout and whitewashed houses, Chefchaouen is a picturesque blue city. What many people do not know is that the city's blue has Jewish origin, from Tekelet dye, a natural dye made from shellfish. In the bible, the Israelites are commanded to use this dye to color one of the strands of their prayer shawl.

## **∙ Chefchaouen - Meknes -** **Volubilis** **- Fes**

![Kinds of projects in Jewish museum](/uploads/1200px-Jewish_Museum_of_Casablanca_Morocco.jpg "Kinds of projects in Jewish museum")

The idea is to have a relaxed breakfast, and go to [Fes](/en/destinations/fez/ "Fes"). On the way, a great option is to stop in the imperial city of [Meknes](/en/destinations/meknes/ "Meknes").Visit the Jewish quarter on arrival in Meknes. Explore the Jewish Mellah with its narrow streets and colorful courtyards.

The presence of Jewish history is evident in Hebrew epitaphs dating back to the Christian era. These epitaphs, together with Greek inscriptions, can be seen in the Meknes zaouia, the place of pilgrimage where the tomb of Rabbi David Benmidan still resides.

Visit the Talmud Torah synagogue. Stay in a typical riad within the medina with Jewish influence. Strolling through this neighborhood is an opportunity to observe an [architecture](/en/blog/moroccan-architecture/ "Moroccan Architecture ") different from the one to which we are accustomed. Although most Jews had left the city after World War II, the architectural heritage remained beautifully. And yet you can enjoy some Jewish shopping. The neighborhood begins next to Flerblantiers Square and features well-preserved buildings and the Star of David.

## **∙ Fes**

![The door of jewish quarter](/uploads/Moroccan_Jewish_Museum,_Casablanca_Morocco.jpg "The door of jewish quarter")

Fes was once the capital of Morocco, and it has Fatimid, Andalusian, Arabic and Jewish influences. The city reached its peak in the 13th century, and it became a center of knowledge, with one of the world’s oldest universities. Fes is also Morocco's second largest city.

The labyrinthical [medina de Fes](/en/destinations/discover-the-ancient-medina-of-fes/ "Discover the ancient Medina of Fes-el-Bali") has more than 9000 streets that create a magical environment between light and shadow. It is considered as a [World Heritage Site](/en/blog/unesco-in-morocco/ "UNESCO in Morocco").

In contrast with the young Mellah of [Casablanca](/en/destinations/casablanca/ "Casablanca"), the mellah of Fes is over 650 years old. This picturesque neighborhood adjoins the royal palace, noted for its recently constructed bright brass doors. Jews took shelter in this palace during the 1912 pogrom.

The nearby cemetery contains the tombs of more Jewish saints than any other cemetery in Morocco. One of the more important saints is Solica, who was killed for refusing to convert to Islam. Visit the community center, Centre Communautaire "Maimonide," one of the most well organized in Morocco, with a kosher restaurant and modern synagogue.

## **∙ Fes - Sefrou - Rabat - Casablanca**

![Old building in Sefrou ](/uploads/1599px-Sefrou,_Morocco_(6343603854).jpg "Old building in Sefrou ")

It is worth taking a trip to Sefrou, the capital of cherries. Sefrou, in the Middle Atlas near Fes, was known as Little Jerusalem because of its high percentage of Jews and their well-developed religious life.

Sefrou was once a major center for the Jews of Morocco and its population estimated at up to 8,000. The first Jewish people lived in the Ahel Sefrou area, most of which converted to Judaism some 2,000 years ago.In the ninth century, a second Jewish population arrived which settled in the region of Tafilalt and in the south of Algeria. Their descendants remained in Sefrou until 1967, when many moved to Israel.

After the independence of Morocco, a rabbi of Sefrou was elected to the Parliament. The Sefrou mellah makes half of the old town. Its white medina is still characterized by its houses with wooden balconies.

## **∙ Casablanca**

![ Temple Beth-El Casablanca](/uploads/معبد_بيت_إيل.jpg " Temple Beth-El Casablanca")

Visit Temple Beth-El, the Jewish Synagogue of Casablanca. While the city boasts more than 30 synagogues, Beth-El is considered the centerpiece of a vibrant Jewish community. Its stained-glass windows and other artistic elements, is what attracts tourists to this synagogue.

The 4.500 Casablanca Jews live outside the mellah in the European city, where they worship in over 30 synagogues, eat in kosher restaurants, entertain themselves in community centers, and attend Jewish schools and social service centers. Beth is the largest synagogue and an important community center, seating 500 persons.

The mellah in Casablanca is young by Moroccan standards, not much more than a century old. It assaults the senses in the evening, with a sea of women in brightly [colored djellabas](/en/blog/moroccan-costumes/ "Moroccan costumes") carrying and selling fruit and vegetables throughout the cramped, narrow streets. While Jews no longer live in the mellah, kosher butchers are found in the old market, next to other butchers selling horsemeat.

Visit the Museum of Moroccan Judaism in Casablanca. The Jewish Museum in Casablanca covers an area of 700 square meters, is the first of its kind in the Arab world. It is a museum of history and ethnography, created by the Jewish Community of Casablanca in 1997 with the support of the Foundation of Jewish-Moroccan Cultural Heritage.

## **∙ Casablanca - Essaouira**

![The grave of Rabbi Haim Pinto](/uploads/Grave_of_Rabbi_Haim_Pinto.jpg "The grave of Rabbi Haim Pinto")

It is worth visiting the coastal town of [Essaouira](/en/destinations/essaouira/ "Essaouira, a trip of beaches, beauties and culture"). It is one of the most beautiful cities in Morocco and is also a multicultural artistic center that has captivated people like Jimi Hendrix, Orson Welles and Bob Marley.

With a cool oceanic breeze that pervades every corner of its medina, the city of Essaouira stands out for its urban and cultural landscape. Besides the gastronomy, based on fresh fish and the use of argan oil. The Medina of Essaouira was built in the eighteenth century and is one of the few in the world that actually had an architectural plan. It was then that the city received the name of Essaouira, which means literally "beautifully designed".

Each year religious Jews from around the world come to Essaouira for an annual pilgrimage to visit the grave of Rabbi Haim Pinto who passed on in 1845. The hiloula celebrating Rabbi Haim Pinto is held each September.

Today the home of Rabbi Haim Pinto and the synagogue have been preserved as a historic and religious site. The building is an active synagogue, used when pilgrims or [Jewish tour](/en/blog/jewish-heritage-in-morocco/ "Jewish Heritage in Morocco") groups visit the city. This is beautiful small synagog that is still kept by one jewish family.

Good trip, back with a heart enchanted with this magical country!
