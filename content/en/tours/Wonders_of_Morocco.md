**Day 1: Casablanca – Rabat**

![Torre Hassan](/uploads/rabat-tour0.jpg "Torre Hassan")

After arriving at the airport of Casablanca you will receive a warm welcome to the country from our guide. 

To start the tour we will go to one of the major wonders in Morocco: the Hassan II Mosque, the second highest mosque in the world, and a rare example of mosques that can be visited by non-Muslims. 

In the mosque, your guide will teach you about the religious traditions and rituals of the Muslim religion. In the words of the author of the book Morocco Country Study Guide, the Hassan II Mosque "undeniably marks the continuity of a modernized ancestral art and bears the sign of innovations that are due not only to technical reasons but also to a fertile exploration of new aesthetic possibilities".

Then we will depart for Rabat, where you can enjoy its beautiful domes, minarets, wide avenues and green 

**Day 02: Rabat - Chefchaouen**

![Rua Chefchaouen](/uploads/chefchaouen-tour0.jpg "Rua Chefchaouen")

Rabat is a city that grew up in the fourteenth and fifteenth century, with the expulsion of Andalusians from the Iberian Peninsula. It is surrounded by three walls corresponding to the most significant stages of its history: the Almohad wall, the Andalusian wall and the Alawite wall. Your guide will show you these walls and the main attractions of the city like the Hassan Tower, situated on top of an imposing mosque and the opulent tomb of Mohammed V, etc.

After lunch we will leave Rabat and head towards the blue city of Chefchaouen. To arrive at Chefchaouen is to dive into a labyrinth of that is unlike other Moroccan medinas, it has a perfect order and harmony. All roads lead to Hamman Square, where it is the largest mosque and meeting center of its inhabitants.

Explore the blue city of Chefchaouen - one of the most charming and emblematic of Morocco. With a calm Medina, nestling between the Rif mountains and the Middle Atlas, Chefchaouen is famous for its handicrafts and goat's cheese.

Suspended and anonymous among the mountains, the city is extraordinarily picturesque, ideal for those who like to explore a city with freedom and to take photos, and for those who find delight in details, in terms of culture or architecture. Enjoy the view over the city, with its soft and continuous shades bathed in light, from the top of a hill.




**Day 03: Chefchaouen – Meknes – Volubilis – Fes**

![Volubilis Detail](/uploads/volubilis-tour0.jpg "Volubilis Detail")

After a relaxed breakfast, we will leave for Fes and on the way we take the opportunity to visit the imperial city of Meknes.

Sultan Moulay Ismail dreamed of making Meknes the most splendid of the cities of North Africa, hence its nickname of "Versailles of the Maghreb". Here we will visit the main points of interest. Nearby it is possible to do a wine tasting: a unique experience for the lovers of wine and impossible to repeat in any other part of Morocco.

We can visit the roman ruins of Volubilis, one of the best preserved roman sites of the world. For a long time, Volubilis was the principal roman administration center in the North Africa outside of Egipt.

Toward the end of the afternoon, we arrive in Fes, where we will still have time to see the city in its splendor, bathed in the soft light of the afternoon. We will take a short panoramic tour of the city.

For dinner, we recommend the Clock Café which always has a very original and diverse menu with original dishes such as a camel hamburger, among other Moroccan specialties that are not easily accessible. This Café also has an interesting cultural life: you can hear an ancient Moroccan tell his stories and talk about the Morocco of old, enjoy a cinema night, have a workshop of Arabic calligraphy, among others.


**Day 04: Fes **

![Fes View](/uploads/fes-tour0.jpg "Fes View")

Visit of the medina de Fes, described by Paul Bowles as “an enchanted labyrinth protected from time”. You will be assigned an extra historical guide who is thoroughly familiar with this city, so that you can discover it deeply: its corners, traditions, stories and history.

The labyrinthical medina de Fes has more than 9000 streets that create a magical environment between light and shadow. It is considered as a World Heritage Site.

Fes was once the capital of Morocco, and it has Fatimid, Andalusian, Arabic and Jewish influences. The city reached its peak in the 13th century, and it became a center of knowledge, with one of the world’s oldest universities.

You will be able to visit the most important palaces, the Jewish quarters, the Madrassa (old school and university from the 13th century) and the Quranic school. Furthermore, you will visit the authentic handicraft of Fes and its work of leathers. It is possible to buy original leather products very cheaply near the place of production, where ancient methods are still used.


**Dia 05: Fes – Azrou – Ifran - Vale do Ziz - Merzouga (dunes of the Sahara)** 

![Merzouga Dune panoramic](/uploads/fdc9591c3-c670-4795-b258-435c0ebd5e0f.jpg "Merzouga Dune panoramic")

We will leave in the morning to visit the magical cedars’ forests of Azrou and Ifran where you will be dazzled with its spectacular native nature. The atmosphere is calm, clear and rich in nature’s scents.

On our journey we will make a brief stop in Midelt, a small town between the High and the Middle Atlas, an exceptional location to watch the exuberant mountain landscape. During our journey, it may be possible to see monkeys and other typical animals of these forests.

On the way we stop in the Ziz Valley, a fertile and exotic Valley and a paradise of calm not disturbed by large touristic groups. Try the dates that grow in this region, and that are unique in its size and flavor. 

Near there are excavations of fossils where today there are several fossils of trilobites among other primitive species. This allows the bottom times of the desert floor of the very indented, already bottom of an ocean. Here you can also buy original fossils at very low prices.

Then we will go to Merzouga, where you can enjoy a traditional Moroccan tea as a welcome sign of affection and you will have the opportunity to see the incredible sky from the hotel with view for the dunes


**Day 06: Deserto de Merzouga – Rissani - Khamlia - Deserto de Merzouga**

![Merzouga friends in Dune](/uploads/Merzouga-tour0.jpg "Merzouga friends in Dune")

Start the day by heading into the deepest desert, where you will have the opportunity to meet nomadic peoples. The trip is made through trails and dunes that our guide knows like the back of his hand.

During the day, participate in different activities in the desert, which can be of the most varied types: extreme sports, Moroccan cuisine workshops or even contact with nomads, immersing yourself in their music and traditions.

We visited Rissani, which is the capital of the historic region of Tafilete. In the past it was an important trading post, as it was on the route of the Sahara caravans. 

There, gold, spices, fabrics, weapons and slaves were traded. It has a market and a souk that is very interesting to visit, it's like stepping into an epic movie from the middle ages, a very authentic place with amazing products, donkey market included!

Afterwards, we will go to the nomadic people's depot of Khamila, a lost village where the original Gnawa people live, first brought from Sudan as slaves. There you can enjoy their music, lifestyle, culture and tradition. Discover life in the middle of the Sahara.

At the end of the afternoon, departure for a camel ride through the dunes of Erg Chebbi, for about an hour, until reaching the Berber tent where you will spend the night. (if you prefer, you can access the tents in our 4x4 car that will be available). The colors of the dunes are the delight of those who love photography.

There, dinner will be served, followed by live traditional music around a campfire. This drum and guitar based song is engaging and irresistible. Then comes the impressive and magical absolute silence of the desert that invites you to interiority. The sky is clear and full of stars. It will undoubtedly be an unforgettable experience!


**Day 07: Merzouga (dunes of the Sahara) – Todra Gorges - Dades Valley**

![Dades Valley](/uploads/Dades-tour0.jpg "Dades Valley")


After an unforgettable night in the desert, getting to know its culture, traditions and trade, you will leave for something completely different, the rocky landscape of the Gorges and the high Atlas and the green beauty of the Dadès Valley.  You will have the unique opportunity to explore the gorges of Todra, towering rock cliffs that reach 600 meters in height, separated by only 10 m in width and that extend through several kilometers.

The Dades Valley is a valley of breathtaking beauty and geological interest. This valley can have arid mountains like the desert, a fertile valley where you can hear the sounds and smells of nature, mountains where you can see snow in winter, and several typical Kasbahs, ancient walled villages. You will be able to see Jbel Saghro, a mountain even more arid than the rest of the range, a landscape compared to the surface of the Moon.

The day ends in peace, in the astonishing Dadès Valley, where you hear the sound of the birds in the green valley. 



**Day 08: Dades Valley - Ouarzazate – Ait Ben Haddou - Marrakech**

![Marrakech Djema El Fna](/uploads/Marrakech-tour0.jpg "Marrakech Djema El Fna")

We follow through the "Route of the One Thousand Kasbahs", until Kalaat Mgouna - The City of the Roses. We will also have the opportunity to visit the traditional villages of Skoura and 'El Kelaa des M'Gouna. A Kashbah is an ancient form of Castle, and even the word “Castle” has its origins in the word “Kashbah”.

After that, we will go to Ouarzazate and Ait Benhaddou, which are two locations of great historical and cultural relief in the Atlas, allowing us to feel as we have traveled in time to see the landscape and the lives of those who dedicated themselves to trade.
In Ouarzazate you can discover the ancient wall, the fortification of Kasba Taouirt and the palace of the Pasha Glaoui. You can visit the movie studios of Ouarzazate, which are the most important in North Africa, that have been used in films such as the famous "Lawrence of Arabia" or "Gladiator".

Ait Benhaddou is considered a World Heritage Place by UNESCO and it is the most important point in the "Route of the One Thousand Kasbahs", a route of small fortifications that would allow the defense of the caravans of trade on its route between the Sahara Desert and the city of Marrakesh. It is still inhabited and used as a set to movies as "Gladiator" and "Game of Thrones", among many others, to keep their identity and charisma intact.

At night, dine at the Jemaa el Fna Square, a market under open sky, where the mixture of scents, songs and shows are inebriating and where the most traditional and typical food can be tasted, without touristic prices. You can also have dinner in one restaurant with a beautiful view over the Jemaa el Fna Square. 


**Day 09: Marrakech**

![Marrakech Souk](/uploads/Marrakech-tour1.jpg "Marrakech Souk")


On this day, we will visit Marrakech, the pearl of the South, and the cosmopolitan centre of the country. The surprising architecture, the intense scent of spices, the colorful and exotic atmosphere, and the small corners and secrets of its history make this city the most desired and visited city of Morocco. 

You will be accompanied by a touristic guide/historian exclusively dedicated to the Medina  of Marrakech, so that you can enjoy the best the city has to offer. 

The attractions are multiple, among which stand out: 

Ben Youssef Medersa:  This Islamic faculty from the 12th century was ordered by the sultan Ali ibn Yusuf of Morocco. Today it is a museum that can be visited. The interiors are wonderful, all decorated and its architecture is exquisite. 

Saadian Tombs: These 16th century tombs were built by Ahmad al-Mansur and there are mausoleums for the bodies of around 60 members of the original Saadian Dynasty in the Draa River valley to the south of the country. Interestingly, the tombs were only found in 1917. These tombs are one of the most visited monuments in Marrakech.

Koutoubia Mosque:  Without any doubt this is the most famous and most photographed monument of Marrakech.The Koutoubia Mosque was built on the 12th century and was a model to the Seville’s Giralda and Hassan’s Tower in Rabat. 

Bahia Palace:  This incredible palace from the 19th century was extravagantly built to be the best of Marrakech. It has an enormous garden, a central courtyard and several rooms amazingly decorated with works from artisans that purposely came to Marrakech from Fez to work.

Palais Dar Bacha, or Musée de Confluences, a wonderful example of Arab architecture. They have a very special cafeteria, where you can taste coffees from all over the world, in a charming atmosphere.
