**Day 1: Casablanca - Rabat**

![Casablanca](/uploads/chateaux_roslane01.jpeg  "Casablanca")

After arriving at the airport of Casablanca you will receive a warm welcome to the country from our guide.
Visits on this day depend on the time of arrival in the city and can be made the next day.

You can have some coffee and try the delicious traditional pastry in the park “de la ligue Arab”, the biggest park in the city of Casablanca, or have some soda by the sea. 

You will go to one of the major wonders in Morocco: the Hassan II mosque, the second highest mosque in the world, and a rare example of mosques that can be visited by non-Muslims. In the mosque, your guide will teach you about the religious traditions and rituals of the Muslim religion. In the words of the author of the book Morocco Country Study Guide, the Hassan II Mosque "undeniably marks the continuity of a modernized ancestral art and bears the sign of innovations that are due not only to technical reasons but also to a fertile exploration of new aesthetic possibilities".

Then you will leave for Rabat, a journey of only 45 minutes, where you can enjoy its beautiful domes, minarets, wide avenues and green spaces.

**Day 2: Rabat – Meknes**

![Chateaux Roslane](/uploads/chateaux_roslane01.jpeg  "Chateaux Roslane")

Visit Rabat, a city that grew in the fourteenth and fifteenth century, with the expulsion of the Andalusians from the Iberian peninsula. It is surrounded by three walls corresponding to the most remarkable phases of its history: the Almohad wall, the Andalusian wall and the Alawite wall.

You will be able to explore the three medinas (medieval cities) of this beautiful and open city. You will visit the main points of the city, such as the Hassan tower or the tomb of Mohammed V.
You can also visit the contemporary art museum Mohammed VI, where you can find the most famous pieces of Moroccan artists of the present / recent past.

We leave in the morning to the imperial city of Meknes, where you can visit the city with the company of an experienced historical guide.

Sultan Moulay Ismail dreamed of making Meknes the most splendid of the cities of North Africa, hence his nickname "Versailles of the Maghreb."

In Meknes, visit the Dar Jamai museum, a Moroccan museum of modern art including painting, jewelry, pottery and tapestry. The museum is housed in an old palace that includes a mosque, a hammam and outdoor gardens. Then you can visit a 14th-century Muslim religious school and also the legacy of AlMoravids, an important dynasty of the twelfth century, present in Meknes.

You can also go for a stroll through the city.

Near Meknes, in a private farm, you can also taste the best wines produced in Morocco (prior booking is required). With qualities similar to Bordeaux wines, Meknes wine is sweeter and more mature than the French due to the region's climate. This area is the only one in Morocco that is DOC (Protected designation of origin) for the production of wines in Morocco. You can spend the afternoon in this beautiful farmhouse, while sampling various wines or enjoying them during a picnic.


**Day 3: Meknès – Volubilis- Fes**

With a fresh ocean breeze that is permanently invading all the corners of its medina, the city of Essaouira stands out by its urban life and culture.

This coastal area, from the time that Carthage was an empire, has always been considered as one of the best anchor sites in the North African Atlantic. Essaouira’s Medina was built in the 18th century and it is one of the few in the world that had in facto an architectonic planning. It was by then that the city was given the name of Essaouira, which literally means "beautifully drawn". The city is also the stage of the famous music festival Gnoa, an old spiritual art form of the North-African Islamism.
