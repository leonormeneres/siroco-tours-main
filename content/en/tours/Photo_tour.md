**Day 1: Casablanca - Rabat**

![Casablanca](/uploads/_DSF3192.jpg  "Casablanca")

Arrival at the airport of Casablanca where our guide will greet you and welcome you to the country.  

After arriving, you will go to one the major wonders of Morocco: the Hassan II Mosque, the second highest in the world, and one rare example of mosques that can be visited by non-muslims. In the mosque, your guide will teach you about the religious traditions and rituals of the muslim religion. 

In the words of the author of the book Morocco Country Study Guide, the Hassan II Mosque "undeniably marks the continuity of a modernized ancestral art and bears the sign of innovations that are due not only to technical reasons but also to a fertile exploration of new aesthetic possibilities".

For the fans of cinema, you can visit Rick’s café, which was built to recreate the bar made famous by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the movie classic Casablanca. Set in an old courtyard-style mansion built against the walls of the Old Medina of Casablanca, the restaurant and piano bar is filled with architectural and decorative details reminiscent of the film: curved arches, a sculpted bar, balconies, balustrades as well as beaded and stencilled brass lighting and plants that cast luminous shadows on white walls.

You can also visit another splendid monument, the Mahkama du Pacha, an administrative building that has served as a courthouse, residence of the governor and parliamentary reception hall, and jail. You can see the French Arab style called Mauresque with strong Moorish elements and the central courtyard resembles the same as the typical Moroccan Mosque. It is open on weekdays from 9-4. 

After visiting the mosque, we will depart for Rabat, where you can enjoy its beautiful domes, minarets, wide avenues and green spaces. Here you will stay at the Cantor Terminus, a hotel that has a stunning view of the city from a nice rooftop. 

**Day 2: Rabat – Asilah – Tangier - Chefchaouen**

![Street Chefchaouen](/uploads/_DSF3455.jpg  "Street in Chefchaouen")

Rabat is the capital of Morocco and it was founded in the 12th century by Almohads. It is surrounded by three walls corresponding to the most significant stages of its history: the Almohad wall, the Andalusian wall and the Alawite wall. Your guide will show you these walls and the main attractions of the city like the Hassan Tower, situated on top of an imposing mosque and the opulent tomb of Mohammed V. 

For lunch, you can go to the Le Dhow, a restaurant/bar lounge inside of a traditional Arab wooden boat. The lunch price is around 20 to 40 Euros per person. 

After, we will leave Rabat and head towards Chefchaouen. Unlike other Moroccan medinas, the “Blue City’s” medina is a labyrinth of perfect order and harmony. All roads lead to the Hamman Square, where the largest mosque and the heart of Chefchaouen’s urban life is. 

It is one of the most charming and emblematic cities of Morocco, with a calm Medina, nestling between the Rif mountains and the Middle Atlas. Here you can find its famous handicrafts and goat's cheese.

Suspended and anonymous among the mountains, the city is extraordinarily picturesque, ideal for those who like to walk freely and take photos. The details and artistry of the architecture is also what makes this town so delightful to see and explore. 

**Photo Moments:**

| In the Spanish mosque you can find the perfect view of the whole town: a puzzle of streets filled with typical blue and white houses. The city sets against the Rif mountains, where the evening sun shines upon and the horizon glimmers in faint pink and purple. If you have time, climb up the mountains in the early morning for a fresh view of the city at sunrise. The hotel that you will stay at is beautiful and has privileged view to the whole city and the mountains behind it.

For dinner, if you want to enjoy a nice view, we recommend going to Hamsa. Alternatively, you can go to Café Clock, a place that often has live music nights and local typical dishes.|


**Day 3: Chefchaouen – Volubilis – Meknès – Fes**

![Volubilis Detail](/uploads/volubilis-tour0.jpg "Volubilis Detail")

After a relaxed breakfast, we will leave for Fes and on the way, we take the opportunity to visit the imperial city of Meknes.
Sultan Moulay Ismail dreamed of making Meknes the most splendid of the cities of North Africa, hence its nickname of "Versailles of the Maghreb". 

We can visit the roman ruins of Volubilis, one of the most preserved roman remnants of the world. For a long time, Volubilis was the principal roman administration center in the North Africa outside of Egipt.

Towards the end of the afternoon, you will arrive in Fes and take a short panoramic tour of the city.

For dinner, we recommend the Clock Café which always has a very original and diverse menu with original dishes such as a camel hamburger, among other Moroccan specialties that are not easily accessible. This Café also has an interesting cultural life: you can listen to the stories of an ancient Moroccan, enjoy a cinema night, participate in a workshop of Arabic calligraphy, among others.

**Photo Moments**

| Visit the beautiful Medrassa BU Inania in Meknès. It is one of the best examples of Moroccan architecture and charm.

Fes’ panoramic view of the city has appeared in famous cinematic shots, such as one of the most popular soap operas in the world, the Brazilian “Clone”. The viewpoint is near the Merinides tombs (one of the first dynasties of Morocco). If you want o enjoy the view from another perspective in a luxury place, you can have a tea in the Hotel Sahrai. 

If the weather is not sunny, we recommend you spend more time Chefchaouen or Meknes instead.

At night you can have a wonderful dinner at the Riad you will be staying at that is located in a privileged position where you can see the whole city of Fes. There you can take an Arabic calligraphy workshop with a master of the craft that will teach you to turn simple messages and names into beautiful works of art (previous reservation needed).|

**Day 4: Fes**

![Fes View](/uploads/_DSF3712.jpg  "Fes View")

Spend the morning and part of the afternoon visiting medina de Fes, described by Paul Bowles as "an enchanted labyrinth protected from time”. You will be accompanied by a guide specifically dedicated to this city, so that you can discover its corners, traditions, stories and history.  

The medina de Fes has more than 9000 streets that give birth to a magical environment between light and shadow. It is considered a World Heritage Site.

Fes was once the capital of Morocco, and has Fatimid, Andalusian, Arabic and Jewish influences. In the 13th century, Fes became a center of knowledge and it is home to one of the world’s oldest universities, the Madrassa, that you will visit, as well as the coranic school, both located in the Jewish quarters. This amazing city is also known for its authentic handicraft: work of leathers. You can visit the tannery, where the skins are treated and the leather is produced, here it’s possible to buy fantastic leather products very cheaply.

**Photo Moments**
| One of the best times to take pictures is early in the morning, when the usually busy streets are empty, and you can capture the light colors and beautiful architecture. The local people wake up early so you will be able to photograph some typical scenarios: a worker with a donkey, shops opening and other mundane but charming activities. The silence at this time of day, also allows us to hear different types of birds sing. 

In cafés, open spaces and squares, like the ones near the blue gate, it is also common to find some of the older workers smoking “keef”, with the traditional long Moroccan pipes. For the morning photography, we recommend going to one of the doors of the city. The walls have many holes and each hole is home to a bird.

Outside the main visit sights, the Rainbow street stands out, a small alley in which the floor and walls are brightly colored. The contrast it creates with the white, grey and wooden tones of the city is remarkable. It’s located between Talaa Kebira and Talaa Seghira, near Bab Boujloud and just next to the café clock. |


**Day 5 Fes – Ifran – Azrou – Ziz Valley**


![Ziz Valley panoramic](/uploads/DSC_0018.JPG "Ziz Valley panoramic")

We will leave in the morning to visit the magical cedar forests of Azrou and Ifran where you will be dazzled with its spectacular native nature. The atmosphere is calm, clear and rich in nature’s scents.On our journey we will make a brief stop in Midelt, a small town between the High and the Middle Atlas, an exceptional location to watch the exuberant mountain landscape. During our journey, it may be possible to see monkeys and other typical animals of these forests.

We will cross the huge fertile Ziz Valley, one of the world's largest oasis, where we will stop to snack and nibble the dates grown here, uniquely known for their size and flavor. You will receive a warm welcome here from the Moroccan people; being a host is an ancient art with deep cultural roots in Morocco.

Some activities you can do here are:

*Moroccan cuisine workshop with local products of the day that you can pick up yourself;

*Stroll around the palm tree forest along the river to the old Ksares; 

*Participate in the manufacture of traditional Moroccan rugs;

*Tattoos with henna; 

*Listen to and dance to traditional Berber music;

*Dress in Berbers’ bride and groom clothes in this sublime landscape.
The peace of being in this palm grove is like being in the desert but surrounded by a luxuriant and harmonious nature. We will spend the night in a beautiful Riad in the middle of this fertile and magical large palm tree forest, where the ground is covered in aromatic herbs. It is the largest the largest palm grove in the world, and still has a lot to explore and discover.

**Photo moments**
| Explore the inside of an oasis with a local so you can capture its true essence from the inside. All the activities mentioned above are great opportunities to take some unique pictures of the tapestry, the typical Berber clothes, the Henna tattoos and the musical and dance moments.|


**Day 6: Ziz Valley – Erfoud – Rissani - Merzouga**

![Merzouga friends in Dune](/uploads/fabien-bazanegue-1Lw1ZSRPm7o-unsplash.jpg  "Merzouga friends in Dune")

Ziz Valley is one of the highlights of the tour. On this day you can personalize your tour by choosing between several relaxing activities, like Moroccan cuisine workshops with biological products, a walk and/or donkey ride to the old Kasbash (old fortified small populations with houses made of layered clay, dirt and stone), spend some time with locals to learn about the ancient agriculture which they still practice or get a Henna tattoo, a dye prepared from the plant Lawsonia inermis, also known as henna tree.

We will head off to Merzouga, and on the way, stop at the city of Erfoud. Nearby, you can visit a live excavation of fossils. Paleontological research shows that the area of Erfoud used to be was a floor of a large prehistoric ocean where many types of marine animals existed. 

After arriving in Merzouga, you can enjoy a traditional Moroccan tea as a welcome souvenir. For the ones who crave adventure, there many activities like scavenger hunts and 4x4 quad bike rides in the great dunes of the desert which you can choose from. The rides can be between 2 to 6 hours and it is ideal if you want to deeply explore the dunes of Merzouga, a UNESCO world heritage site. You will also go on a camel ride thought the desert for about an hour and visit some of the most beautiful oases of the desert.

The colors of the late afternoon in the dunes are the delight of those who enjoy photography. Going on top of a dune to gaze at the sunset is a great opportunity to capture unique colors reflected on the infinite sea of sand.  

You will experience an unforgettable night under a constellation of stars in the sky. There, dinner will be served and then there will be traditional live music around a bonfire. And then the silence of the night will fall, and you won't hear anything besides your own voice or your companions'.

**Photo moments**
| The desert is not a monotone landscape: it has dunes, mountains, even rivers and lakes. The desert can made of rocks or sand and you will discover its natural wild life. You may find nomads and the smile of their kids will give you memories that will last years!
Our guides are from the deep desert, the off-road undiscovered part of the nomads. They know the desert like the palms of their hands, a rare and precious privilege!|


**Day 7: Merzouga – Todra Gorges – Dades Valley**

![Dades Valley](/uploads/06turwjvoksz.jpg "Dades Valley")

After an unforgettable night in the desert, getting to know its culture, traditions and trade, you will leave for a completely different experience:  the rocky landscape of the Gorges, the high Atlas and the green beauty of the Dades Valley. 

We start the day by visiting the Medieval town Rissani, known for its very beautiful entrance gate and its traditional weekly market and souk with plentiful crafts. The souk is open every day but is much more active on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. 

You will have the unique opportunity to explore the gorges of Todra, towering rock cliffs that reach 600 meters in height, separated by only 10m in width and extending through several kilometers.
The day ends in peace, in the astonishing Dades Valley, where you can hear bird sounds in the green valley.

**Photo moments**

Visit the Dades Gorges, smaller than their Todra counterparts, to capture beautiful pictures. |


**Day 8: Dades Valley – Ait Benhaddou – Ouarzazate – Marrakech**

![Marrakech blue](/uploads/1582459678901.jpg   "Marrakech blue")

We will also have the opportunity to visit the traditional villages of Skoura and 'El Kelaa des M'Gouna. A Kashbah is an ancient form of Castle, and even the word “Castle” has its origins in the word “Kashbah”.

After that, we will go to Ouarzazate and Ait Benhaddou. Both of great historical and cultural relief in the Atlas, these two locations allow us to feel as we have traveled in time to see the landscape and the lives of those who dedicated themselves to trade.

Ait Benhaddou is considered a World Heritage Place by UNESCO and it is the most important point in the "Route of the One Thousand Kasbahs", a route of small fortifications that would allow the defense of the caravans of trade on their route between the Sahara Desert and the city of Marrakesh. It is still inhabited and has been used as a set for movies such as "Gladiator" and "Game of Thrones", among many others, to keep their identity and charisma intact.

**Day 9: Marrakech**

![Marrakech Souk](/uploads/Fes_Souk.jpg  "Marrakech Souk")

On this day, we will visit Marrakech, the peal of the South, and the cosmopolitan center of the country. The surprising architecture, the intense scent of spices, the colorful and exotic atmosphere, and the small corners and secrets of its history make this city the most desired and visited city of Morocco.

During the day you will be accompanied by a touristic guide/historian exclusively dedicated to the city of Marrakech, so that you can enjoy the best the city has to offer. 
The Marrakech guided visit is divided into two parts: Inside and Outside the Medina. 

**Inside the Medina:**

Madrassa Ben Youssef: This 12th century Islamic college in Marrakesh was built by Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf of Morocco. Nowadays, it is a museum that can be visited. The interiors are wonderful, decorated with beautiful Muslim motifs and typical craftsmanship.

Koutoubia Mosque: Without a doubt the most famous and most photographed monument in Marrakesh. The Koutoubia Mosque was built in the 12th century and served as a model for the Giralda in Seville and the Hassan Tower in Rabat. 

Bahia Palace: This beautiful, extravagant 19th century palace has a huge garden, a central courtyard and several rooms incredibly decorated with works by artisans who came on purpose from the city of Fez to work on its construction. 

Saadian Tombs: These 16th century tombs were commissioned by Ahmad al-Mansur and there is a mausoleum with the bodies of some 60 members of the original Saadian Dynasty in the country's southernmost Draa River valley. Interestingly, the tombs were only found in 1917. These tombs are one of the most visited monuments in Marrakech. 

The famous Souks (traditional markets) where you will see the wonders of Moroccan handicrafts and experience fun and exotic moments.

**Outside the Medina:**

We will visit Marrakesh outside the Medina with our guide and go to various places:  
Majorelle Gardens: This is the only botanical garden in Marrakesh. It was designed by artist Jacques Majorelle and belongs to Yves Saint-Laurent and Bergé Pierre since 1980. You can enjoy a wonderful garden with exotic flower species from all over the world. 

Yves Saint Laurent Museum, which has a permanent exhibition as well as temporary exhibitions, with masterpieces by this famous creator. The building itself has lovely modern architecture with traditional touches. 

La Menara: This Marrakech garden is located 2 km from the Jemaa el-Fna square and is the favorite spot of the Marrakchis for a Sunday afternoon walk. These gardens were built in the 12th century, but the present construction dates back to the 16th century.

**Other Interest Points:**

*The modern district of Gueliz;

*Palais Dar Bacha and Musée de Confluences, both a wonderful example of Arabic architecture with a very special cafeteria, where you can taste coffees from all over the world, in a charming atmosphere. 

*Palmerie de Marrakesh: enjoy the beauty of this palm forest and where you can spend fun times taking a camel ride.

**Day 10: Marrakech**

![Marrakech Bahia](/uploads/Marrakech-tour2.jpg "Marrakech Bahia")

In the morning there may be time for some last shopping in the agitated souk of Marrakech.
We go to the airport where we say goodbye with certainty to have made new friends and unforgettable experiences and memories.


**Extra days in Marrakech**

An extra day in Marrakech offers a lot of different opportunities. Many of these activities need prior booking so they need to be set up ahead of time. 

La Maison Tombée du Ciel means “House that fell from the sky” and it is a house created by French artist Jean-François Fourtou where everything is inverted. Inside, the doors are built on the floor, the entrance is through the windows, furniture hangs from the ceiling and the house itself is built upside down! It resembles a dreamy scenario, straight out of a Tim Burton movie! 

Cactus Thiemann is the largest cactus garden in Africa. The visits are private and you can explore a rich and varied flora that is definitely worth capturing through a good camera! If you love photography, nature or both, the Cactus Thiemann is a must see. 

Afternoon tea/spa at Royal Mansour: A simple glance at the giant gates of Royal Mansour will immediately give you the impression that you are about to enter a special place. The hotel was commissioned by the king of Morocco himself and he saved no expense. Inside, every detail has been carefully considered creating a harmonious and luxurious design. 

You can have an afternoon tea experience (around 55 euros per person) at the indoor bar or the outside patio, adorned with beautiful traditional tiles and gorgeous fountains. 
The entrance is through a charming citric garden that welcomes you to relax. 
The spa is magnificent, open but private, which is perhaps not surprising, given it has 2500m2.  The rates of the spa are similar to some other spas in Marrakech, given its quality and location (hammam/massage ranging from 130 to 200 euros). 

![Marrakech extra days](/uploads/Picture_10.jpg "Marrakech extra days")


After each of these experiences, you can request to visit its wonderful grounds and garden.
Agafay lunch: In the vast plains near Marrakech, you can visit the desert of Agafay, a barren and rocky landscape where astonishing camps are set. You can have lunch here and decide which environment you would like: a more rustic and hippie-chique set or a more opulent with or without a pool to the plains of Agafay.

Goats on trees: On the road to Essaouira it is possible to see one of the most picturesc sights in Morocco: the goats on top of the Argan trees, a unique phenomenon.

Astronomy night in Marrakech – At the palmerie of Marrakech, you can take part in the “Astronomy Night”.

You can observe in high detail the planets of the solar system, galaxies, nebulas oriented through professional telescopes assisted by professional astronomer. Depending on who is conducting the astronomy night and with sufficient preparation, it may be possible to attach a camera to the telescope. 

The Confluence museum, which previously was the palace of the governor, is not as touristic as other museums. Also, inside the museum you have one of the most beautiful cafés of Marrakech, the Dar El Bacha. There are frescos decorating the walls and an amazing gourmet restaurant menu!

Museum Dar Si Said/Museum of Marrakech: The museum of Marrakech was a restoration of an old Mnebbi palace, commissioned by Omar Benjellou, a great Moroccan patron and collector. The exhibition is composed by ceramics, weapons, rugs and other traditional objects from different parts of Morocco. 

Le Jardin Secret: The Secret Garden is located in the Mouassine district of the Medina of Marrakech near the Madrasa Ben Youssef and the Mouassine Mosque. The complex is divided into two parts:

* The "Exotic Garden" with plants from all around the world: Jaracondas from South America, plants from Madagascar, among others.

* The "Islamic Garden" is a representation the paradise described in the Koran. There is fragrant lavender in the middle of a bed of light, windswept herbs bordered with rosemary. Olive and orange trees shade the sofas pleasantly positioned on both sides of the fountains. 
Explore the souk: To feel the true pulse of the red city, dive into the thrilling souk (market) of Marrakech which cloaks the vibrant colors, exquisite ornaments, unlimited surprises, and unique experiences. Photography enthusiasts will be spoilt for choice.  From Jemaa el Fna, the souk extends to the north part until the Museum of Marrakech. The souks are named after the product that is being sold there.  They often still look similar to what they did a thousand years ago. 

![Goat on trees](/uploads/goat_trees.jpg "Goat on trees")

The main street in the Marrakech market is the Souk Semmarine. There are several types of products for sale: patisserie, pottery, high-quality clothing and textiles produced with typical Moroccan methods, including beautiful wool jackets and beautifully embraided cotton harem pants. You can also find antiques, rugs and jewelry. 

Souk el Attarine is known by its metal works of copper, brass and silver. Typical Moroccan colorful lamps are made of these materials. Near, explore the Spice square, where you can also find perfumes and Argan oil.

**Extra day in Asilah and Tangier**

![Asilah](/uploads/_DSF4031.jpg  "Asilah")


We move on to the artistic little town of Asilah, a city full of memories and history, where the Portuguese left a very strong imprint.

The Medina and ramparts have been restored in recent years, and the narrow but quiet streets and alleys, lined with whitewashed houses, adorned with mural paintings and richly ornate windows are ideal for a stroll. 

The city is a favorite place for photography in Morocco.

As you walk through the Medina, you will discover different paintings on the wall at every corner. This historical place is where the different shades of blue and white merge creating an atmosphere of serenity and freshness. In the late afternoon, go to the ramparts near the sea where you can contemplate an impeccable Atlantic sunset.

Tangier is a city where two different cultures merge: African and European.

One of the most popular spots is Cape Spartel, which is located about 12 kilometers northwest of the center of the city of Tangier, where you can enjoy the beautiful view of the turquoise color of the Atlantic Ocean and the dark blue of the Mediterranean Sea. Visit the spectacular Hercules Cave, a natural cave formed by thousands of years of waves crashing against the rocks. And it resembles a map of Africa against the Atlantic Ocean.

**Photo Moments**

| Asilah is one of the most underestimated pearls of Morocco. A city full of street art, large painted murals, beautiful beaches and local handicraft. 

The Hercules caves in Morocco are an amazing geological landscape to photograph. 
In Tangier go to the elegant and fresh Salon Bleu. Up the white spiral staircase, the third and fourth floor have a very beautiful small terrace facing the medina with a view to the distant sea. On a sunny and breezy day, it is a lazy spot to sip a cup of mint tea. 

A large square that serves as a link between the oldest and the most modern part of the city. The views, the terraces and the great atmosphere it gives off invite you to sit and look at the life of Tangier from a distance.

For dinner, enjoy a beautiful piano bar in Tangier, reminiscent of the golden age of the “20’s”, the “El Morocco club”. It is the perfect place to go in the afternoon, in the middle of the ancient city center of Tangier. |
