Mulei Idris, also known as Mulei Idris Zerune (in Arabic, Moulay Driss Zerhoun or Moulay Idriss Zerhoun), is a small town and municipality in northern Morocco, the most sacred city of Morocco for Muslims. It is a compact city with narrow streets reminiscent of the Moroccan medina. So narrow that donkeys are needed to make goods transports up hill. It is a city sheltered from the noise of cars, with just the noises of the market and birds!

Moulay Idriss lies on the road between [Meknes](/en/destinations/meknes/ "Meknes") and four kilometers from the [Roman city of Volubilis](/en/destinations/volubilis-ruins-of-the-ancient-roman-empire-in-morocco/ "Roman city of Volubilis"). It is part of the Meknes and Meknes-Tafilete prefecture and is situated in a very picturesque location on the slopes of Mount Zerune in two heights rocky valleys surrounded by three green valleys and very fertile, dominating the vast Saïs plain. They are exact 25 km north of Meknes and 60 km west of [Fez](/en/destinations/fez/ "Fez"). In 2004, Mulei Idris had 12.611 inhabitants and it was estimated that in 2012 it had 12.633 inhabitants.

It is sacred for it to find the mausoleum of the direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad (Muhammad's daughter Fatima), Mulei Idris (Idris I), the most revered saint of Morocco, founder of the city in 1789 and the first Arab and Muslim from Morocco, the idrid dynasty. It was there that Moulay Idriss arrived in 789 bringing the Muslim religion with him and initiating such an important dynasty. Because of its undeniable historical and cultural importance, since 1995 the city is a World Heritage candidate according to UNESCO's first, fourth and sixth criteria.

According to the story, Moulay Idriss sought refuge in Morocco after ascending to the power of the Abacidas, enemies of his family. In Morocco, he obtained support from the Berber tribes, being proclaimed iman (counselor of the Muslim faith) in 789.

One after another, all the principal tribes of Morocco swore loyalty to him. However, he ended up being murdered by his Abacidas enemies. Since then, the city has become a place of pilgrimage for Moroccans.

Moulay Idriss Zerhoun is a holy place for Moroccans and has a special place in their heart.

Like other Moroccan holy cities, it was forbidden for non-Muslims until 1917, and until the first years of the 21st century only Muslims could stay overnight. Because of this, there are no major touristic hotels inside the city, but the good news is that it is possible to rent private rooms. The city attracts many tourists and non-Muslims, for the beauty of landscapes, traditional streets and commercial activity.

In addition, it is the pilgrimage destination of many devotees - according to tradition, seven pilgrimages to Mulei Idris are equivalent to a pilgrimage to Mecca. For several generations the first official visit of the King of Morocco after his coronation is Mulei Idris.

Curiously, Moulay Idriss is shaped like a lying camel. The city is composed of 2 districts: Tasga and Khiber. The houses with their green roofs are built on top of each other. The streets lead to the mausoleum of its founder, right in the center of the city.

Unfortunately, the only place forbidden to non-Muslims is Mulei Idris's mausoleum. But there are still plenty of things to visit. Although the entrance to the mausoleum of Idris I was forbidden to non-muslims, the city preserved as few as the atmosphere of the Maghreb almedines. Stuffed with modern buildings in front of the old and traditional, with beautiful azulejos and arabesques and lots of history to tell.

## **What to see in Moulay Idriss**

The mausoleum of the city's creator is open only to Muslims but can be seen from the outside. It is in the interior of a zauia and its present aspect results mainly from the reconstruction carried out in century XVIII by Mulei Ismail. During the reign of Haçane II (1961-1999) several improvements were made, namely the construction of Koubba Al-Hassania (dome on the mausoleum).

Another great place to marvel is the mosque with the only round minaret in Morocco. One of the peculiarities of the place, still more surprising as it is a modern construction (from 1939) in a place so traditional and old, is the only cylindrical minaret of Morocco, covered in green tiles with arabesques.

A modern cylindrical minaret, decorated with green tiles that reproduce verses from the Koran, contrasts with the predominant style of architecture.

The city is also full of panoramic terraces. The large terrace (great terrase) and the small (petit terrase) are the best spots of Mulei Idris to observe the city.

A stroll in Moulay Idriss is something picturesque and authentic, as the city has and unique characteristics worldwide. The area of ​​the craftsmen is a place to discover, near the main square. Speaking of the Moulay Idriss I square, it is the most interesting in the city, an ideal place to relax in one of its cafes and see the atmosphere of the place.
