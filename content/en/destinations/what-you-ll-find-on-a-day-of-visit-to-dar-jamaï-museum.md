The Dar Jamai museum is one of the main tourist attractions in Morocco. If you are thinking of visiting it, this is your chance to know better what lies ahead.

The Dar Jamaï Museum, with all its historical content, it is located in the city of Meknes, in the Hadim Square, north of Morocco. Was originally a private residence built in 1882. Of Hispano-Moorish type, this majestic palace is a specimen of the homes of the "families of the Makhzen" Moroccan late nineteenth century. Belonging to Mohamed Ben Larbi Jamaï, grand vizier of Sultan Moulay Hassan I (1873 - 1894), this vast house ended up being sold to Glaoui of Marrakech, who never lived there. In 1912, the French recover the building, but not to make a museum there. They set up a military hospital in its central part. It was not until 1920 that the building was entirely attributed to the Regional Inspectorate of Fine Arts, which turned it into a museum with a large handicraft gallery. Since then, Dar Jamaï is classified as a historical monument, and most of its collection consists of objects dating from the 19th and 20th century.

Dar Jamaï's collections consist of ethnographic objects made of different materials (wood, textiles, ceramics, metal, baking, paper). The first funds date from 1917, and were enriched by the acquisition of some carpets between 1980 and 1990, which testify to the artisanal know-how of Meknes and its region.

The thematic tour is spread over two levels. Upon entry, visitors have a taste of the permanent exhibition, consisting of weapons, embroidery, woodwork, damascene or ceramics. One of the main halls is originally the Palace Mosque, where today is a beautiful 17th century Minbar in painted and carved wood. In the other rooms on the ground floor, traditional embroidery and costumes, urban and rural jewels, and the brasserie and traditional ironwork of Meknes are on display. Finally, upstairs, a corridor gives access to the Qobbat, reception room or ceremonial, where are exposed Korans and Manuscripts.
