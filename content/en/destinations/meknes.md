Moroccan Versailles, the other way what this beautiful city is called. The first settlement on the site of a modern city arose in the 7th century. Originally the city was called Kasba, which means "fortress". In the tenth century, the Berbers called him Miknas. During the reign of Ismail, Miknas was renamed Meknes and became the capital of Morocco. However, after the death of the ruler, the city lost its importance as a capital. Today, **this city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the imperial cities of the Kingdom.**
