Since 2014, the National Museum of Ceramics Safi, like 13 other Moroccan museums, has been entrusted to the National Foundation of Museums. As part of its museum renovation strategy, the National Museum Foundation (FNM) has developed a restoration and rehabilitation project for the Safi National Museum which requires its temporary closure.

Ceramic museum SAFI was built under the Almohads (12-13th century), the citadel that houses the National Museum of Ceramics has been listed as a historical monument since 1922. Its location, overlooking the medina of Safi and offering a beautiful view of the ocean, attests to its role defensive. Between 1508 and 1541, the citadel is occupied by the Portuguese, as evidenced by the coat of arms of King Emmanuel I visible on one of its towers.

Under the Alawite dynasty, around 1762, Prince Moulay Hicham built the "Bahia", palatial residence, which will give this building the name of "Dar Soltane" ("House of the Sultan").

After having been the office of the civil controller under the French protectorate, the monument became the seat of several Moroccan administrations, before hosting the National Museum of ceramics in 1990.
