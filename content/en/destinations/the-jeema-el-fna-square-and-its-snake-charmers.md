Snake charmers are one of the most famous parts of Morocco. They attract the public by exoticity, as this from snake charmers looks like something out of Hollywood or Bollywood movies. To complement the setting, all that is missing is the flying carpets and genie out of magic lamps. The snake charmers are many in Marrakesh and are generally situated in the main places of tourist passes, more of night than day. For those who do not have snake phobias, you can still take pictures of them closely, wrapped around your body and around your neck, and you can pay to have this memory on your camera.

In these places, sellers are joined to the enchanters, making the culture light and marvel the eyes. Some of the souvenir sellers in Marrakech, along with the snake charmers, stroll through the square with wooden snakes for tourists to carry as souvenirs for their homes. They even start to frighten snake toys because, to attract attention, they move them in the direction of tourists' hands. The result is laughter surprises and curious eyes the exoticism of the place. One of these places and perhaps the most famous of them, called Jema el-Fnaa, came to be considered "a masterpiece of Oral Heritage and intangible heritage of humanity" by Unesco. The cause is this variety of cultural manifestations freely displayed in this square.

Take a notice, however, that the snake enchanter may ask you for money so, as in some of these experiences in Morocco, it is best to ask for the price before engaging in what may seem a spontaneous activity.

## **The Jeema-el-Fna Square and its enchanting exoticities**

After spending some time bargaining for prices with the lively vendors in the legendary medina (old town) of Marrakech, a must-see place while you are in the Moroccan city is Jema el-Fnaa Square, which is the old heart of the city. Not just crowded with tourists, it remains heavily visited by locals.

Behind the reddish walls of Marrakech, the Jeema-el-Fna square houses an exotic spectacle. Not least because every day it changes, from day to night, every time, from an open empty square used for traffic of cars, motos and people, to a place full of culture and spectacales in the eveningIf you want to know this square completely, try to do this visit in every part of the day. As soon as the sun sets, there is a new movement and new things to see and do, with stalls from different artists. Snake charmers, storytellers, healers, food stalls and juices, artists of all kinds, dancers, clowns, acrobats, storytellers, musicians, fakirs, women who make paintings (such as tattoos that last for a week ) henna and water vendors mingle with tourists - the mythical watersheds, as they are called these sellers in their typical colored clothes and the noise of the bells, follow a long known tradition of selling water to those who passed by - the glasses of brass are for Muslims and those of white metal for those of other religions.

Within these traditions and so much movement, the square is a mixture of colors and sounds that comes to stun, of so much variety, that translates the Moroccan soul. In addition to the different activities you will see, you can still stop to visit the terraces of the cafes and restaurants, which surround the square, which is why you have the best view - take amint tea with the original Moroccan sweets. It is also near here that are parked the caliches, carts with horses that make walks in and around the Medina of Marrakesh.

During the day, adjacent to the square, the natural orange juice stands are set up. Their prices are very low, compared to all other places, at around 4Dh (around 0.4 euros) a cup. You can ask that the vendor do the juice in front you and we recommend that you ask that they donâ€™t add ice since it is probably not done with mineral water.

Accompanying it, there are also stalls of dried fruits and herbs. There are monkey trainers, sine readers, and shoe shiners. In the evening, the scenery remains impressive: lanterns are lit and groups play their instruments, while in the food stands hundreds of people try local dishes such as couscous and tagine. At night, the sound of the drums of Berber music, a people that inhabits Morocco since before the arrival of the Muslim Arabs, continue and stand out even more. The change is visible. They set up restaurant stalls, with lots of smoke and the smell of their cooking. You do not even need to speak Arabic, just point to what you want to eat.

## But after all, how does the enchantment of snakes work?

In the middle of traffic, walking restaurants and traditional music and everything else that animates Jemma El Fna square, this is an image that draws attention in the middle of the confusion:

The snake charmers show their millenial art - it seems to have emerged in Egypt for many centuries - by dancing snakes to the sound of their flutes. Usually the chosen snake is a Naja, due to its splendid appearance and being very common in this region.

But, in fact, it is not the sound of the flutes that seduce the animal.

The fact is that the snakes, when they feel the vibrations, leave the basket. The enchanting movements of their flutes are that they keep the snake's attention in its direction, and the strong threat posture of the animal sings in beauty. The baskets are dark and, when opened, the serpent instinctively seeks the light, which makes its movement even stronger. To guide your movements, just move the flute, making it more charming. Curious, is not it?

Snake charmers are a very important part of local composition and culture. The preparation, concentration and millennial ability to make entertainment passes from generation to generation.
