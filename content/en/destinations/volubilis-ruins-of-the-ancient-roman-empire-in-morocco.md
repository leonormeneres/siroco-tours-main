5 km from [Moulay-Idris](/en/destinations/the-sacred-city-moulay-idriss/ "Moulay-Idris") and 31 km from [Meknes](/en/destinations/meknes/ "Meknes") tourists are met by the majestic ruins of the ancient Roman city of Volubilis.

Volubilis is translated from Latin as "generous". Long before the appearance of the Romans, the Phoenicians lived in these places, then the Carthaginians. Volubilis, rebuilt by the Romans, sharply differs from the rest of Morocco by its regular urban planning, unusual for African culture. In Volubilis for a long time already conducted archaeological research, thanks to which there is an opportunity to touch the old stones, which once boiled life. Today, the storks give a semblance of life to the ruins, which are nesting here every spring.

Since 1997, Volubilis has been protected by **UNESCO as a World Heritage site**.

It was built in 217, 19.28 meters wide and 3.34 meters deep, was erected by Marcus Aurelius. At the top of the arch was previously a bronze chariot drawn by six horses. This composition was made and brought from Rome, in 1941 it was partially restored. The arch was created in honor of the Emperor Caracalla and his mother Julia Domna.

### **Mosaics**

In the distant past, the houses of wealthy patricians were adorned with various **mosaics** with images of scenes from life and legends. For example, through the centuries, many mosaics very well preserved, showing scenes of hunting or fishing. Often the mosaics depicted the Romans themselves. Mosaics usually laid out the floor and walls in the houses of noble townspeople, and they also decorated public baths.

### **House of Orpheus**

One of such noble houses has survived to this day, it is the **house of Orpheus**, as it is inscribed in Latin over the entrance. Its unusual mosaics were made in a rich color scheme of smalt, terracotta and marble. The dominant figures of the central mosaic are the ancient Greek god Orpheus with lyre, horse and elephant. Attracts attention to the mosaic floor, which depicts nine frolicking dolphins.

### **Forum**

Remains of the forum area are of ​​1300 square meters, it already housed the statues but in the III century they were taken out by the Romans, and now only pedestals remained in their place.

### **Capitol**

This structure was described by Emperor Marcus in 217. Thanks to these records, archaeologists managed to identify the ruins of the Capitol and fragments that were close to it. This allowed later to carry out its partial reconstruction. The construction is distinguished by perfectly flat columns and amazing stone blocks of stairs that give an idea of ​​the grandeur of the building itself and the level of architectural skill of the Romans in that era.

### **Basilica**

The building of the Basilica used to house administrative and judicial authorities of the city. All important state affairs and issues were resolved there. Three naves, separated by two rows of columns with Corinthian capitals, are noteworthy. Arched openings are well preserved in the wall and corners of the building.

### **The greatness of the Volubilis columns**

One can not help noticing the large number of **columns** in the city. Despite the impressive height, almost all of them are well preserved. Their abundance is amazing. There are columns made of bricks, or carved from solid stone, and one can only marvel at what technologies were used at the time to cut symmetrical patterns so accurately, to make perfectly flat threads along the entire height of the columns or the capital. In the lower part of the columns, very small figures of animals, fishermen, hunters and various ornaments are cut out.

### **The main road is Volubilis Dekumanus-Maximus**

This strikingly straight road, reminiscent of modern avenues, was laid from the **triumphal arch** to the gate of Tangier, strictly from north to south. The houses of the Volubilis aristocracy were located along the Dekumanus-Maximus, behind them was the aqueduct running parallel to the road, supplying them with water, and in the middle of the road a sewage system was installed.

### **House of Dionysus**

This building is interesting for its mosaic "Four Seasons", featuring different styles of performance, common in those days in Rome.

### **The house of Venus**

Quite large and beautifully decorated building with a patio, surrounded by eight rooms. There are seven corridors downstairs. The floor of the House of Venus is decorated with a mosaic. It was here that the famous exhibit, the bust of Yuba II, was found. Excavations in the House of Venus helped to collect the bulk of the exhibition of Roman art, presented in Rabat and Tangier.

### **Brothel**

This object enjoys constant interest among tourists. Nothing of an artistic nature, it was an ordinary brothel, in which the soldiers of Rome relaxed.

### **House of Bacchus**

This place is remarkable for the fact that a statue of Bacchus was found here by a miracle, since all the statues were taken out by the Romans. Since 1932, the statue is the pearl of the collection of the Museum of Archeology of the city of Rabat.

The city of Volubilis survived not one earthquake for its history. But not only earthquakes changed its appearance. In the seventeenth century, Moulay Izmail decided to build the city of Meknes, and many elite building materials were removed from Volubilis: marble, columns, decor elements. The final tragedy with the city was played by the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. Only in 1874 began the digging of Volubilis from under the wreckage of archaeological groups.

Visiting this mysterious place in Morocco envelops the traveler with the mystery of antiquity, the breath of history and leaves a vivid and memorable trail.
