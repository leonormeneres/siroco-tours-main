The gardens of Morocco are many and very beautiful. The Majorelle Garden is a botanical garden with inspiration in the Islamic gardens. Among them, the botanical garden Majorelle is beautiful, a true oasis. Its name is a homage to the French painter Jacques Majorelle, who constructed it in 1931.

In 1937, Majorelle created this Majorelle blue an intense cobalt blue, with which he painted the walls of his house and grounds. The wholegarden looks like a picture.

The garden has lakes with fish and benches along the paths, so you sit and enjoy this island of calm, even so close to the hustle and bustle of downtown Marrakesh.

In 1966, Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé, cofounder of the Yves Saint Laurent brand, fell completely in love with this place on their first visit to Marrakech.

After the death of Majorelle, the truth is that the place went into decay. The passion of Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé for Marrakesh allowed him to rehabilitate with mastery. The love of the place is well in sight in all the parameters in the current garden.

The house located in the interior is classified as "Maison des Illustres" (Maison des Illustres) by the French Ministry of Culture since 2011.

We recommend you visit the Majorelle Garden early in the morning. It is one of the most touristic sites in Marrakech so the visit is worth it when you can spend the time needed to make the most of it. With approximately one hectare, there are in the Majorelle Garden approximately three thousand botanical species, among them 1800 species of cacti, of many heights, and 400 varieties of palm trees. It occupies about one-hectare northwest of the almedina and houses about 3,000 botanical species. There are exotic plants, rare species and lots of green space. Beside the plants, you can find the legend with a scientific name and explanation about it - the explanations are of the own Majorelle, that composed during its trips around the world. After enjoying so much tropicality, you can enjoy green tea or mint tea in the cafeteria.

There are places where everyone loves to take pictures. Like the bank with the blue background, for example. In fact, so much color attracts attention. Some describe the place as "an impressionist garden" or "a cathedral of shapes and colors".
