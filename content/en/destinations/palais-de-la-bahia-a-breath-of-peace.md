The Bahia Palace is one of the most impressive palaces in Marrakesh, it took more than a decade to be built, and the construction was probably between 1859 and 1867. The exact date is unknown.

The name of the palace is a debate. Some say it means "brightness," others say it means "the beautiful". There are several theories as to whether the name is due to the palace itself or whether it was a tribute to the vizier's favorite woman. In that case, it would be "The Palace of Beauty". It is located in the medina (old part of the city), next to the north side of mellah (Jewish quarter). Everything around is tumultuous, but when you cross the palace gates, it's like entering another world. Its construction is gigantic: in the 8 hectares of extension of the palace, there are 150 rooms that are united in diverse courtyards and gardens. The most interesting part of the Bahia Palace is the harem of the 4 wives and 24 concubines of Abu Bou Ahmed. The harem includes a vast courtyard decorated with a lake and surrounded by rooms intended for concubines.

## The History

This construction was carried out by the great vizier of Sultan Abdelaziz Si ​​Moussa. At the end of the 19th century, it was in the hands of Abu Bou Ahmed, a black slave who became the vizier. This helped to bring the palace to its climax. It is one of the most important [architectural ](/en/blog/moroccan-architecture "Moroccan architecture")masterpieces in Marrakech, and the aim was indeed that it was the most impressive palace of all time.

It is known that the Moroccan architect Almaqui (El Mekki) was hired between 1859 and 1873 to direct the construction by Si Moussa. The son of Si Moussa, Amade ibne Moussa (1841-1900) hired the architect Mohamed ibne Maqui to enlarge the palace in 1894, and a mosque, hamam and vegetable garden were added to the complex.

Walking through the environments of the Palais de la Bahia is like walking through labyrinths, passing halls, courtyards and reaching the main courtyard, with a labyrinth of corridors and staircases linking several sites. The rooms are empty, but its architectural style "Andalusian Arabian" lacks decorations. There are many tiles, stucco, paintings, fountains, patios and gardens occupying an area of ​​8 thousand square meters. Right at the entrance, to the south, there is a riad, a smaller family residence than the palace, all tiled with zellige tiles with stucco ceiling carved in cedar, and its three sides give access to three richly decorated halls. In the middle there is still a garden, with a fountain and fruit trees. The chirping of the birds contributes to compose the environment of supreme beauty idealized by the Arab architecture.

The back yard is huge, having three fountains, dozens of rooms all lined with blue, white and yellow tiles. The floor is with the typical Moroccan emerald-colored pattern. Through it you will be able to reach another huge garden, with more fountains, more rooms and more and more environments.

The Palais de la Bahia today belongs to the Ministry of Cultural Affairs of the Government of Morocco. Part of it is used for the reception of government officials from other countries, for art exhibitions and concerts, mainly of Arab-Andalusian music, and as temporary housing for the royal family of Morocco - during this time, especially during winter, the visits stop. The government assumed the administration of the palace in the years 2000 and since then has been taking care of the restoration and conservation of the surroundings.

The eastern hall leads to the council room and from there, through a vestibule with a remarkable painting on the ceiling, one can reach the large courtyard of the original palace of Si Muça. To the west and east of the great riad are richly decorated halls with zellij fireplaces (colorful Moroccan tiles) and painted wooden ceilings. The exit of the palace is made by the private apartment built in 1898 for Amade's wife, Lala Zinabe, where once again stands the painted ceiling and carved stucco, in addition to stained glass windows.

Besides beauty, the Bahia Palace is full of stories. As the palace is empty, in order to enjoy the visit and to know what is in each room, besides knowing better the origins of this beautiful place, we recommend hiring a tour guide. Of course, the Palais de la Bahia is one of the most beautiful places to meet in Marrakech. Every room, hallway or hall surprise and impresses.
