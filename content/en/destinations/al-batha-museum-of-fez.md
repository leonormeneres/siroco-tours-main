## **General presentation**

Originally, the Al Batha Museum is an audience palace and a summer residence, built at the end of the 19th century by Sultan Moulay Hassan I. His successor, Moulay Abdelaziz, will complete and embellish this building, Arab-Andalusian style.

In 1915, the palace was transformed into a Museum of Popular Arts and Traditions, and a few years later, in 1924, it was classified as a National Heritage Monument.

Currently, the museum houses a permanent archaeological and ethnographic exhibition, reflecting the arts and traditions of the spiritual capital of Morocco.

The Museum also preserves the oldest pieces of Islamic art in the kingdom, such as the Idrisside beam and the minbar of the Mosque of the Andalusian district.

The Museum offers a thematic itinerary that allows the visitor to discover the art of living and the trades and traditions of Fez and its region through more than 6,500 objects. Among them, exceptional items, such as Korans and prayer books, embroidery, musical instruments, astrolabes, jewelry or carpets.

Not to mention several potteries - regarded as the most beautiful in the kingdom - as well as a collection of traditional ceramics of the region, decorated with stylized floral interlaces color "blue of Fez".

But the Batha Museum is not just his collection. It is also his garden, landscaped by the landscape architect Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier in 1915, thought in continuity with the palace. With its colorful mosaics, Arabo-Muslim fountain and palm trees, hibiscus and jacarandas, this place exudes a sense of serenity unique in its kind.
