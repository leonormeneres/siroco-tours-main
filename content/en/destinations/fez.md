Fez (Fes) is not only the largest center of religion, culture and education of the country, but also the oldest of the four imperial cities (three more - Meknes, Marrakech, Rabat). Despite its centuries-old history, this amazing city remained a true example of the Muslim Middle Ages, where practically nothing has changed. Its winding streets are also like labyrinths, in the old neighborhoods from century to century the same families live, street markets invariably sell slippers-grandmothers and Berber carpets, and urban tanners are also treating the skin according to old traditional technologies that are transferred from generation to generation. This unique city, bright and resonant, **is a true monument to ancient times**, where travelers from all over the world seek each year.

Fez was founded in 789 by the great Moroccan saint Moulay-Idris I. According to legend, he was given a hoe of silver and gold. With this hoe, he outlined the boundaries of the fortress, which was to become the capital of the dynasty, at that time ruled in Morocco. Then he could not even imagine that Fez would become the center of an empire stretching from Spain to  Senegal. At the end of the XII century it was, almost **the largest city** in the entire Islamic world. In the middle of the 14th century, the Berber dynasty of the Marinids transferred the **capital** to Fez. Immediately after the declaration of independence in Morocco (1956), Fez began to flourish and gradually gained the status of the largest cultural and economic center of the country.

**In general, the city of Fez consists of three parts:**

* **The old medina** – Fes El-Bali, surrounded by a medieval wall and since **1981 listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site**. It is one of the largest pedestrian areas in the world;
* **The new medina** – Fes El-Jdid, founded in the 13th century, on whose territory the monuments of the Marinid period and The Jewish cemetery, the Royal Palace, and the Bougelood Gardens are located;
* **The new city of Fez** - a modern part of the city, laid in 1916.

In total, the medina consists of more than **nine thousand streets, squares, lanes** - many of them end in dead ends. Small areas that are located at the intersection of streets are active trade sites. All areas of the medina, and more than 300 of them, have **five key landmarks**: a mosque, a madrasa, a fountain, a hammam and a bakery.

![The medina of Fes](/uploads/1024px-Fes_(5364182941).jpg "The medina of Fes")

The conditional boundary between the old medina and the new medina is the gate of Bab Bou Jeloud (Bab-Bu-Jhelud), built in 1913. Outside, the gates are lined with patterned tiles "Zellige" in green tones, and from the side of the old city tiles in blue tones (green - the color of Islam, blue - the color of Fez).

In the hot and dry climate of Fes, the roof is a very valuable space and is actively used. Almost all houses have flat roofs, on which they dry clothes, grow plants, and in the evening, when some coolness comes, they rest. The main streets are lined with thousands of shops, handicraft workshops - almost all businesses are the family business.

## What to see and where to go in Fes

### Fes el Bali

![Blue gate](/uploads/1600px-Fes_Bab_Bou_Jeloud_2011.jpg "Blue gate")

Perhaps the main attraction of Fes-el-Bali is still the medina itself, the impression that everyday life produces within its walls. People trade, work, rest, do all the same things as for many centuries. The streets here are very narrow, some only 60 centimeters, the broadest - about five meters. The area is considered pedestrian, and goods are transported on donkeys, mules and scooters. Although in some parts you can see small trucks, mostly they take out the garbage.

The oldest part of the city has existed since the founding of Fez in 789. It has 14 gates, 6000 streets, 200 mosques and about 180 temples. Here are some of the most beautiful historical buildings in Morocco, two of which were erected in the ninth century - the Andalusian Mosque and the University of Al-Karaouine.

### Madrasa Bou Inania (Bu-Inania)

![Madrasa Bou Inania](/uploads/Fes_-_Madrassa_Bou_Inania-1.jpeg "Madrasa Bou Inania")

It is the largest madrasa of Fez, built between 1350-1357. The entrance to the madrasa is decorated with wooden leaf doors, finished with bronze. You will be surprised by the view of the magnificent portal with heavy, wooden, skilfully finished doors. A strikingly beautiful building of the 14th century. The facade of the building is adorned with the ancient water clock of the XIV century, unique. The courtyard is decorated with marble, onyx and valuable tree species. Be sure to go and admire, you will not regret. Keep in mind that in shoes here you can’t start up, you must remove it before you go inside.

### Karaouine Mosque and University

![raouine Mosque and University interior](/uploads/Fez3-3.jpg "raouine Mosque and University interior")

Another treasure of Fez - the mosque of Karaouine (al-Karaouin) or the Mosque of Kairouan - It is the most impressive building in Fez and the second largest mosque in Morocco. It is hidden deep in the heart of the medina, among hundreds of shops and houses. Here is also one of the oldest universities not only in Morocco, but all over the world. Its minaret dates to 956 and is the oldest Islamic monument in Fez. It is also the most sacred mosque in Morocco and regulates the calendar of all Islamic holidays in the country.  Now it holds about 20,000 believers. You can view the mosque only from the street, since only Muslims can enter inside.

### Quarter of tannery

![Famous quarter of tannery](/uploads/Fez1-3.jpg "Famous quarter of tannery")

Fez is famous for its crafts, but this landmark is very popular among tourists - here for the same technology as hundreds of years ago, they treat the skin. In the numerous shops adjacent to the dyers, you will be offered a wide range of leather products. Try to choose older sellers, they offer more adequate prices. The highest price - for products made from camel skin, the lowest - from goat. And do not forget to bargain. From the shops you can go out to the terrace and consider how the production of dressing, drying and dyeing of the skin works. Although because of the terrible smell, very few people will survive the excursion here. Immediately you can buy a bunch of mint to slightly muffle the smell.

### Fes El-Jdid

![Beautiful yard in Fes medina](/uploads/photo-1538349901073-131b5a4c9cd7.jpeg "Beautiful yard in Fes medina")

The new medina, created in the 13th century by the merinies, where the **Jewish quarter** (Mellah) and the **Royal Palace** are located as well as **lively souks and craft shops**. The highlight here is to visit the Royal Palace (only outside as it is forbidden to enter) and the alleyways of the Jewish quarter, to visit its synagogue and the Jewish cemetery.

### Royal Palace - Dar El Makhzen

![Royal Palace of Fes](/uploads/1280px-Fes.Dar_el-Makhzen-1.jpg "Royal Palace of Fes")

The territory of the palace is huge, about 80 hectares. There are also mosques, madrassas, schools, museums, and beautiful gardens. Part of the palace complex belongs to the King of Morocco, which happens here. The interiors are very luxurious. Here are collected priceless treasures from all over Morocco - carpets, ceramic and copper products, silk fabrics, weapons and ancient manuscripts.

### Jewish quarter (Mellah)

The Mellah is the Jewish neighborhood that is in Fes El-Jdid, where we will find great activity. In its streets the goldsmiths have established their stores giving life to this place.

Although today the Mellah even looks cheerful and active, there were different moments in Moroccan history where the area was used to limit the Jews and inhabitants of the region, thus achieving different objectives related to social control and the expansion of the Jewish community in Morocco.

![Kinds of ceramic products](/uploads/Fez9.png "Kinds of ceramic products")

In the Mellah you can appreciate the architectural difference of this neighborhood with its characteristic narrow streets, its balconies and openings to the exterior decorated with elements in wood. It is highly recommended to have a guide who tells us the rich history of the area.

Overall, Fez, easily captivates and fascinates the traveler with an amazing history thanks to the multitude of mosques, madrassas, fountains, ablutions, "green monuments" (historic gardens), manufactories, mausoleums, palaces and residences, squares and bazaars.

An excursion past all the main attractions and interesting souks can take almost all day.

## Food

![A variety of dried fruit](/uploads/Fez4.png "A variety of dried fruit")

Fez cuisine is the best in the country, so it's no wonder that in the city literally at every corner you can see a small national restaurant or a snack bar. Local chefs are famous for the fact that very often sweet and salty foods are combined in one dish, and fruits are also used instead of vegetables. In addition, almost all meals are generously flavored with a variety of spices and seasonings (cumin, cinnamon, coriander, sweet or hot pepper, etc.).

## Local cuisine in Fez

![Delicious cuisines in Fes](/uploads/moroccan-cuisine-800x445-1.jpg "Delicious cuisines in Fes")

The main treat of Fez is the so-called pastilha - puff pastry with pigeon meat, almonds and sugar. No less original and tasty dishes, which are most common here, are meat tadzhin with quince, lamb with prunes and dried apricots and duck with nuts and raisins. An integral part of any Moroccan meal is delicious fresh bread, which is served with cumin and salt. Well, as a dessert, seasonal fruits or sweet pies with honey, nuts, cinnamon and sesame are usually served. All these delicacies are washed down most often with sweet mint tea or fresh and cocktails with almonds and avocados. It is worth noting that, even though Morocco produces excellent wines, the Muslim religion prohibits the use of alcohol, so in the national restaurants they are served quite rarely.

## Entertainment and recreation

Even though Fez is a calm and rather old-fashioned city, any tourist can easily find an interesting variant of pastime. For example, here you can **play golf** (there is a magnificent field) or go **horseback riding**. You can go on a multi-day horse trip with stops in Volubilis and Meknes. **Tennis** is no less popular in the city. So, every year there is the Grand Prix tournament of Princess Lalla Meryem, in which the most famous tennis players take part.

Fes is also famous for its numerous **festivals and holidays**, of which the most popular were the **Festival of Sacred Music**, the Cherry Fair and the Jazz Festival in the Riads.

### Festival of Sacred Music of Fez

![Scared music performance](/uploads/13.jpg "Scared music performance")

If you travel to Fez el Bali in early summer, try to be there for the World Sacred Music Festival, usually scheduled for the end of May or early June. Artists from all over the world gather to perform at the Festival of Sacred Music of the World. The event attracts international stars and local talents. You can count on daily musical performances of Berber ritual music, Sufi chants, Konya Dervishes, Japanese drums, or Tibetan monks and Russian Orthodox choirs. The performances take place in a variety of outdoor places in the city. The festival offers more than musical performances, and you'll want to take time out to visit the visual arts exhibitions, movie screenings and poetry readings. For a more intellectual taste, you can attend literary discussions in local cafes.

## Nightlife in Fez

As for night entertainment, the clubs and bars are only in the territories of large hotels. In addition, many hotels and restaurants offer all sorts of **short-term courses or shows of Fez cuisine, pottery, calligraphy, story-telling and Arab-Andalusian music.**

Almost all the establishments to consume alcohol in Fez are centered in the bars of the hotels.  Fez is a much more traditional city than Casablanca or Marrakesh, and it is technically illegal to drink alcohol in public. The purchase of alcohol or drunken walking around the city will be cause for bad faces and looks.

![Fes cafe and bar](/uploads/5493941833_68fec2d8a4_b-1.jpg "Fes cafe and bar")

* Mezzanine - It has three floors and an additional outside patio. The nightlife area is from 12 to 02:00 am. Enjoy a cocktail, beer or wine on the terrace.
* Barra de L’Alcazar -  After a hard day in the Medina, L'Alcazar bar is an oasis of comfort and relaxation, the perfect backdrop for a memorable moment with friends and the family. It has a living room with excellent decoration and style. The bar and the lounge offer an extensive choice of cocktails, malt, cognac, wines and a variety of cigars.

![Moroccan essential oil spa](/uploads/1574246729000-1.jpg "Moroccan essential oil spa")

For those who want not only to relax, but also to improve their health, a lot of **hammams and spas** work in Fez. Also, in the city there is a luxurious thermal center "Moulay-Yakub" with warm healing springs.

## Where to go shopping

We could say that Fez is the **capital of crafts**, the city can be proud to have a great and attractive artistic experience in the various crafts that work in **ceramics,  wood  or  leather** ,  Fez is a place where  trades  have become art. The medina is the paradise of artisans. The largest number of such markets is concentrated in the old district, which is famous for its special oriental flavor. There are several interesting specialized markets in Fez, for example, the El-Attarin spice bazaar, the Fish and Salt Market, the Ash Shabin medicinal plants bazaar, etc.

![Colourful babouche shop](/uploads/DSCF5381-2.JPG "Colourful babouche shop")

However, the main commodity of Fez, of course, are **leather products**, which are sold in the famous quarter of tanners. The leather in the city is made for a very long time, and it is processed according to old recipes, without the use of alkalis and acids, so the residents of the whole country come here for quality and original bags, jackets and accessories.

By the way, if you want to take something memorable from Fez, you can grab embroidery from the market, they are very skillfully made here, with great love. The city produces brocade by hand, it is quite old, traditional for Fes fishing, which can easily be called familiar.

In addition to the **markets and bazaars** in Fez, of course, there are large shopping centers and supermarkets, where you can buy virtually everything, but there is no unique oriental atmosphere there. It is worth saying that there is no generally accepted schedule for opening and closing shops in Fez, so most of them work on an individual schedule. Well, the markets and bazaars here are open almost the entire light-day.

## Transport

![Petit taxi](/uploads/1540281021_72add3cb48_b-1.jpg "Petit taxi")

In Fez, public transport is represented by city buses, the cost of transportation is about $ 0.3. It is worth noting that buses do not have a clear timetable, and you can learn the route of their journey only from residents. In addition, bus stops are often not designated, so you can understand exactly where the bus should stop, by the crowd of people gathered near the road.

Taxis in Fez are mainly represented by Petit taxi, which are designed for three people. They do not usually have a fixed fare, so you need to negotiate the price in advance.
