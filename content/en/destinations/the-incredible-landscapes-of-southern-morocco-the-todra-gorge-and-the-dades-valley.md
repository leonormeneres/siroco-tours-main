The Valley of Dades and the Gorges of Toudra are two natural attractions that are necessary in your visit to Morocco, especially if you pass on the way to and from Merzouga, for example.

The valleys are beautiful, with roads and towns lining the palm oasis. The gorges are an imposing and relaxing place, with the river and water courses in which one can take a nice and refreshing bath.

If you are gathering much expectation about the Todra Gorge and the Dades Valley, you will not be disappointed. It is situated about 17 kilometers from Thinghir, and the Dades areas are about 150km from Ouarzazate. Once this gorge was difficult to access. Today, an asphalt road does not take more than fifteen minutes to make the journey. The best news is that the great adventure that will be this visit already begins on the road. In fact, a long day of travel means many magnificent landscapes. You will arrive already full of beautiful memories and photos.

This region, bordering the Sahara, is of utmost importance to the history of Morocco. Trade routes of salt, gold and slaves between Black Africa and Morocco have fused local Berber populations, so that Arabs, Berbers, the desert people, and the descendants of former black populations are intertwined in the small villages on the edge of the great roads.

In fact, passing through the small villages will give you the opportunity to experience the importance of the roads, the dislocations, the paths, to a people accustomed to changes and wanderings. It will be a high point and a great cultural feeling of your trip.

The Todra Gorges, northwest of the city of Tinghir. This is also a very sought-after area for climbers. It is suitable for all tastes: it is also worth arriving in the morning and, taking advantage of the sun, make a short and flat walk inside the Throat. The place is beautiful, and your photos will look even better under the sunlight.

Your walk through the gorge can also follow the course of the river Todra, water of great importance for the landscape. It is good that you will have even more time to observe and absorb the grandeur and beauty of this gorge. The steep cliffs of the canyon are practically vertical walls at certain points.

There are many people who spend days there, climbing, or even doing the trails.

Ahead of the astonishing todra Gorges, you find a green valley with its own gorges, the Dades Valey.. Walking among the rocks of this gorge, between walls that are even 300m high, is impressive. The feeling before the immense landscape is that we are very small. You will marvel at everything - impossible not to marvel at this place out of a book of fairy tales.

The Dades valley lies just north of the town of Boumalne-Dadès and stretches for about 100 kilometers. This route is also part of the route of a thousand _casbahs_, **The Casbahs are fortresses or fortified villages, built centuries ago by the Berber peoples of the region. This type of building served to house the population and the animals in a safe place, protecting itself from the attacks of the invaders of the time.**

The valley is characterized for being an arid landscape of reddish color, strongest in the eyes of those who observe, of marked warm traits. The casbahs (constructions made of earth and dry straw) are therefore of the same reddish color of the land. The river Dades that runs in the valley is a source of life, in its margins the vegetation is concentrated, with fruit trees like apple trees, fig trees, almond trees and date palms. It is thanks to the river that we owe the existence of these trees and the ecosystem itself. A very interesting detail of the region is to see the sheep grazing on the stone slopes. Along the way you will cross certainly with some shepherds accompanied by their numerous flocks.![Countless black goats walking among the rocks](/uploads/Todra_Gorge4-1.jpg "Countless black goats walking among the rocks")

The Dades Valley presents also dramatic landscapes where the green of the fields and the luxuriant vegetation of the banks of the river mix and the arid brown of the surrounding mountains. It is rude and beautiful at the same time.

**If you are in the area, don’t miss the chance to visit** El KelaaM'gouna, known as the [Valley of the Roses](/en/destinations/the-valley-of-roses/ "The Valley of Roses").
