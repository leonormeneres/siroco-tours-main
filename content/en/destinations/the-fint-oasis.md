Do you dream of losing yourself in grandiose landscapes? Stroll along, accompanied by a guide, through the unique beauty of the Fint oasis! Although not widely known outside of Morocco, the Fint Oasis was used as the setting for some Hollywood films, including Babel, Prince of Persia and Kingdom of Heaven. （[Morocco in cinema](/en/blog/morocco-in-cinema/ "Morocco in cinema")）

The Fint Oasis is located just over ten or eleven kilometers south of Ouarzazate, also to the south of Morocco. With similarities to a palm grove situated in a rocky valley along the river near Ouarzazate, it is, like all oases, a kind of garden in the desert. This sense of oneness will be further amplified by the fact that the road to the oasis is calm, desolate, completely abstracted from agitation. You can walk and talk freely, listening to this wonderful place.

Despite the streets around the Ouarzazate that aim to build a new city authorized by the government, everything in the city is still brown and desert gravel. From seeing the same color and landscape, your eyes will be dazzled when Fint comes in the middle of the path - very green, full of life and beauty.

It is perfectly understandable: anyone finds it almost impossible to imagine, starting from Ouarzazate and across the dry and desolate terrain of the Anti-Atlas Mountains, that such a green, exuberant and lively place might soon be on the horizon. But suddenly you notice: a massive and verdant palm grove, filled with plants, animals and village life.

It will be your time of refuge after the aridity of the Atlas Mountains. If the city of Ouarzazate is considered the "gate of the desert," then the Fint Oasis may well be the desert garden. It resembles a green temple, with surprising people and many animals to go there. There is the giant palm grove, filled with trees, people washing their clothes in the river and a village life that always seems vibrant despite the midday heat.

By all accounts, there are four traditional villages in the vicinity of the Fint oasis. These villages make up the neighborhood and blend the sub-Saharan, Moroccan and Berber cultures. Its inhabitants are not mainly Berbers (in reality, there are less Berber than is customary in other places), but descendants of sub-Saharan who will have stayed in Morocco. The hospitality of these families is well recognized by all.

On the streets, you'll get used to the donkeys walking and working. The inhabitants of Fint are descendants of the people who stayed in Morocco from the caravans of commercial exchanges between North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.

You will not miss what to do during your stay. There are even the options of doing donkey or even car trips or enjoying the weather and the fresh water and swimming. And, of course, savor leisurely the famous mint tea from Morocco while enjoying all this fantastic weather.

As a visitor you will probably take the opportunity to dine with a local family. In fact, it is possible, for a modest fee, even a brief stay in one of these houses. It is an incredible experience of cultural and gastronomic exchange. Also do not miss one of the evening musical performances that show the unique combination of Berber, Arab and African rhythms.

Depending on how much time you want to give away, you can choose to spend an entire day, or your passage through the Fint Oasis may be shorter. Just to enjoy the scenery and take great photos, which are sure to be wonderful memories. If it is in good season, here is also recommended the visit to the [the valley of the Roses](/en/destinations/the-valley-of-roses/ "the valley of the Roses").

But the trip does not stop there. To spend the night, you can visit the lush beautiful oasis of Skoura larger, not so remote, but still outside the major touristic routes. do not miss the visit to Kasbah of Tifoultoute. This impressive 300-year-old castle looks like something out of Lawrence of Arabia - and indeed, the Kasbah served as a hotel in the 1960s for the cast and crew of the film. Extraordinary panoramic views are available on this next tour.
