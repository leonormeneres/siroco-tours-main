## **General presentation**

Inaugurated on July 29, 1948, the Ethnographic Museum of Tetouan is nestled on a historic fortress built by order of the Alawite Sultan Moulay Abderrahmane around 1830.

The museum and its garden are reminiscent of traditional palaces and houses, with its central basin, its wall fountain covered with zellige, and its terrace on which are exposed many guns of Portuguese origin.

Through its collections, the Ethnographic Museum of Tetouan illustrates certain cultural and ethnographic aspects of the city and its region, through two main themes: "public life" on the ground floor, and "privacy" on the floor.

The first space gives pride of place to the various socio-educational and religious activities that take place in the public space (mosque, zawiya, artisanal, space). The opportunity to discover the traditional artisanal production of Tetouan and its region, which covered many trades imported from Andalusia from the 15th century. This part of the museum presents trades specific to the region, namely the work of leather, pottery Rifaine, and the art of zellige. Zellige has always been one of the most typical craft trades in Tetouan.

The second space, upstairs, is a dive into the atmosphere of the traditional Tetouan houses of the 19 th century. The woman is at the heart of this space, with objects that bear witness to the different evolutionary phases of her life, from her birth through the first rites aiming at her integration into socio-cultural life and her marriage. The large salon recreates the ceremony of traditional marriage of Tetouan. Visitors can discover cushions embroidered with silk thread, walls covered with "Haiti" fabric and mirrors adorned with embroidered "Tenchifa". At the exit of the living room is exposed the beautiful caftan worn by the bride on his "Ammaria" and his trousseau, arranged in beautiful wooden chests.
