**El-Kelaa-M'Guna** is located in the heart of the Atlas Mountains also known as **The Valley of Roses,** it is the homeland of the famous _Damask rose_. According to the legend, these tender and fragrant flowers were first brought here in the 10th century by pilgrims returning from Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). Annually, plantations in the foothills of the High Atlas, collect more than five thousand tons of roses, which are used to make the precious essential oils and aromatic rose water.

_“It's the time you spent on your rose that makes your rose so important...People have forgotten this truth, but you mustn't forget it. You become responsible forever for what you've tamed. You're responsible for your rose.”_

### **∙ Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, “The Little Prince”**

The Damask rose, a flower of very capricious nature, requires special conditions such as a specific climate and soil to grow in. _El-Kelaa-Mguna_ is one of the few places on earth where these fine roses grow. It is said this rose befits a “real queen” due to its luxurious character.

At sunrise, when the amount of oil in the flowers reaches its peak, the Damask rose is collected and transported to steam distillation. At least three tons of petals are required to produce just one liter of essential oil. Every year, florists organize a grand feast to celebrate the season’s rose harvest.

Colorful in the literal sense of the word, the _Annual Rose Festival_ takes place in the "Valley of Roses", Morocco, at the end of the second week of May. Here, a ritual takes place where people shed each other with pink petals. Ten tons of roses are used to make a “festival” oil, one of the main attractions that can be bought there. The festival is a tourist attraction as well as an activity for locals: a lavishly decorated motorcade that passes through the streets, folk [dances](/en/blog/music-and-traditional-dances-from-morocco/ "Music and traditional dances from Morocco ") and competitions, [handicraft](/en/blog/crafts-of-morocco/ "Crafts of Morocco") exhibitions, an agricultural fair and [music](/en/blog/music-and-traditional-dances-from-morocco/ "Music and traditional dances from Morocco ") performances take place at the fest.

For this holiday, locals learn and prepare the so-called **"bee dance"**: a folk dance that symbolizes a woman as a bee and a man as a beekeeper. Under the rhythmic battle of tambourines and trills of a flute, a story tells us that a beekeeper can’t live without bees, and bees can’t live without flowers.

**Valley of Roses** is an area of splendid **greenery**, nestled at the foot of a canyon of ocher tones. One of the most important tourist sites, The Valley of Roses in an absolute beauty and can’t be missed.
