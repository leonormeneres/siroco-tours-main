46 kilometers south of [Tangier](/en/destinations/tangier/ "Tangier") and 110 kilometers from Ceuta lies a small Moroccan city that has recently become a tourist destination on **the north coast of Morocco**: **Asilah**, a display of white houses that contrast with the blue of the Atlantic and streets that invite you to get lost in a world of radiance and color.

## **Asilah and its historic value**

![White and blue house on the Atlantic coast](/uploads/assilah-3316017_1280-2.jpg "White and blue house on the Atlantic coast")

Like many other enclaves of the Moroccan coast, Asilah was visited by **Greeks and Phoenicians** who left evidence of their presence, such as Zilil, which dates from the second century B.C. Later, the place was taken by the **Carthaginians** and in the 1st century B.C. was occupied by the **Roman Empire**, who named it “Colonia Augusti Iulia Constantia Zilil” (Augusta Zilil).

For centuries, the Romans occupied the city until it was conquered again by **the Arabs** in 712, giving rise to a new golden age, in which Asilah became enveloped by the charm for which it is famous today. Spanish, Arab and Portuguese merchants found Asilah, in the north of Morocco, to be a strategic location for commerce.

The Saharan gold fever **led Portugal to take the city in 1471**, only to abandon it almost a century later. During this time, the Portuguese built walls that fortified Asilah, which later became one of its major tourist attractions.

After several attempts at reconquest, Spain appropriated the area after its alliances with Portugal, and made it **part of the Spanish Protectorate until 1956** despite the many assaults of various Moroccan dynasties for years.

Today, Asilah showcases all its historical legacy and is one of the most picturesque towns in Morocco.

## **The Medina of Asilah**

The Medina of Asilah is characterized by the luminosity of its sky and the constant sound of the sea that can be heard in the streets These bright streets are known as the “Lantern of Asilah” and its paving is the work of local artists.

The houses are white, adorned with mural paintings by visiting artists. Some are being rehabilitated with beautiful Andalusian design, blending white with indigo blue. The small mosques of Asilah are painted completely white.

**The walls that surround the old city** were built by Alfonso V of Portugal in the 15th century. Three entrance doors open to the Medina, which are called:

* **Bab Homar** or Puerta Tierra, decorated with the coat of arms of the King of Portugal, which today are almost erased by the passage of time.
* **Bab el Bahar** or Puerta del mar, next to the square Portuguese tower that overlooks the entire city.
* **Bab el Kasbah** in the northern zone surrounded by gardens, in front of the Muslim cemetery.

Inside the enclosure, there is a labyrinth of alleys that runs between the white houses, which contrast the green and blue shutters and doors.

Entering through the **Bab el Kasbah**, you will run into **the untainted white Grand Mosque**, or **the El Kamra Tower**, an iconic 50 meter structure in Asilah. In front of it, **the Hassan II Center**, with its exhibitions and international events, is the cultural epicenter of a city that brims with color and creativity.

As you stroll through the Medina, you come across the charming **Ibn Khaldun Square**, ideal to be captivated by small markets such as the Nashia or Les Amis bazaars, where a variety of products are sold: from lanterns to Moroccan nuts and sweets. The atmosphere is characterized by the flavors that come from the terraces, tearooms and restaurants. Here, you can peacefully enjoy a cool Moorish tea. One of the famous activities is climbing one of **the most famous sections of the old Portuguese wall: Borj Al Kamra**, which offers some of the best views of the city: a landscape of ancient canyons that adjoin with the Atlantic.
