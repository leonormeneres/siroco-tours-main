Choosing the right route for your trip to Morocco will depend on your wishes and tastes. Many travelers come to Morocco looking for sunshine and relaxation, while others want to discover the exciting [culture](/en/blog/culture-of-morocco/ "Culture of Morocco") and history of Morocco, not to mention the adventurers who come looking for natural landscapes, sports or less tourist destinations.

## **Yearn for culture and history**

![route](/uploads/1581321143064.jpg "route")

If you are looking for a vacation to immerse yourself in the culture of the country, discover its [traditions](/en/blog/customs-and-traditions-of-morocco/ "Customs and Traditions of Morocco ") and broaden your horizons, Morocco is your destination!

The two most interesting cultural cities in Morocco are [Fes](/en/destinations/fez/ "Fes") and Marrakech. Those eternal rivals disputed the capital of the country near 900 years. We also reserve the city of [Meknes](/en/destinations/meknes/ "Meknes"), built by Moulay Ismail who wanted to create a "Versailles of Morocco".

Each of the three imperial cities will take at least two days to visit. For a short trip, less than 5 days, we suggest you decide on one of these cities. If your stay lasts a week or more and you want to see as much as possible, do not hesitate to visit these three cities.

### **∙ Fes, Meknes and the surroundings**

Fes is the historical capital of Morocco. Built in the 8th century, it is the oldest of the four imperial cities. Declared a World Heritage Site since 1981, Fes has preserved its monuments.

If you stay for more than 3 days in Fes, you can take several excursions:

About 60 km away, you will find the city of Meknes, the most obscure of the imperial cities with its majestic monuments, which is one of the best places to visit. If you like archeology you can also take the opportunity to visit the ancient [Volubilis](/en/destinations/volubilis-ruins-of-the-ancient-roman-empire-in-morocco/ "Volubilis"), the oldest city in Morocco.

In less than an hour's drive, you can reach the Ifrane National Park. At the heart of the Middle Atlas, the park shines through the diversity of its landscapes, lakes and streams. They highlight Morocco's largest and perhaps the most beautiful cedar forest.
