The Draa Valley is a beautiful set of natural landscapes of great tourist value. It is in southern Morocco, as well as south of Ouarzazate, between Agdz and Zagora, in the Sahara Desert. It is a natural stop for those coming from Marrakech to the desert of Zagora. It is home to one of the two most important rivers in the south of Morocco and, thus, it is of great importance, because of the small oases that you find in it and the ancient population that inhabit it.

The Draa River, coming from the High Atlas, descends the mountain by digging a canal bottom along steep rocky canyons of the Jebel Sarhro Mountains. The Draa River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. With climate change over the years, the waters of the river now seep into the desert sands and follow the course underground, driving more than 600 kilometers into the ocean.

Thus, its landscapes are contrasts: on one side the green of the palm grove with its beautiful passage of the water, and on the other the dry aspect of the desert. Due to this natural wealth, since ancient times, the Draa Valley has always been a point of passage for the great caravans that crossed the desert.

In the Draa Valley, you're right at the doorstep of the desert. All the green is born from the Draa River, the largest in the country, which descends the mountain of the High Atlas and brings water to the most unlikely places. It's easy to follow your course as well as the surrounding green landscapes along its canals. Elsewhere he cannot see his riverbed, he hides among mountains.

The Draa Valley is outlined by a waist of palm trees that indicate the presence of water in those places - a true oasis, which contrasts with the rest of the arid and dry landscape. The palm grove, with thousands of palm trees, has about 200 km and is accompanied by oases and villages with houses made from the typical adobe. Appreciate the villages - in addition to transmitting much about this people and the culture, they were even movie sets.

Delight yourself with the distinctive rock formations that surround the valley. You will want to touch the stones, so mysteriously shaped and embedded in each other that they are almost indistinguishable. In a form and almost supernatural beauty. You will benefit greatly from this geological map, whether you are a scholar of that area. The geological variety and the landscape richness will take care of attracting your attention.

Try the delicious dates here. The waters of the Draa are also the main reason why so many families have settled in this area. Enjoy to take photos and rest.

Its inhabitants, being Arabs, [Berbers](/en/blog/what-do-you-know-about-the-berber-people/ "What do you know about the Berber people?"), Jews and descendants of Mauritanian slaves, have gathered in fortified settlements to protect themselves from nomads in search of plunder. The casbahs of the Draa Valley, surrounded by fields and palm trees, have become practically city-states. Within its walls were all that the communities needed to live.

The waters of the Draa provide food for thousands of families living on its shores. There are irrigation systems, agriculture - which continues to be the main activity of all populations along the valley - and population clusters.

The Draa valley is, moreover, a range of small oases that fight the stubborn invasion of the sands. This is, by the way, one of the oldest wars of the Berbers - to prevent the invasion of the sands to their meager fields of cultivation. The presence of water is not always sufficient to guarantee the practice of agriculture. With the Sahara so close, the maintenance of the arboreal part is a matter of nature's decision. There are shrubs and bamboo canes preventing the advancement of the sands. According to the Berbers, just hear the hissing of the wind coming from the Sahara. **And the name of this wind is… Siroco! And that is the inspiration for the name of our company.**

Kasbhas, such fortified dwellings, emerge in the landscape framing the scenery. Small portions of religiously tended land occupy entire families. You will see children playing, full of energy, fed by nature.

In the Draa Valley we can enjoy spectacular scenery of rivers, palm trees, mountains and hundreds of kashbhas and fortified villages. Already close to Agdz, it is impressive to leave the mountain and see the first of the oases of the Draa Valley, with thousands of palm trees that contribute to this being the region of the dates.

The Draa River disappears occasionally. Even in winter the event happens. The great permeability of soils - which indicate the existence of large amounts of sand in their composition - provides a troubled course to the Draa waters. When the ground allows it, it goes there following its natural course to the top of the earth. Right in the eye. When the permeability increases, the waters disappear in a trip infiltrated in the sands。

If you are interested in a place that allows you to feel nature in its totality, in its varied forms and in its purest innocence, the Draa Valley will enchant you.
