The Pearl of the Alantic, famed for its charm and tranquility, is a wonderful place to unwind. Here are a few tips for two days filled with taste and sensory experiences and discoveries.

## · **First day**

### **8 AM Breakfast, Moulay El Hassan Square**

![Traditional breakfast in Essaouira](/uploads/32752429525_ed8f3cbd21_b.jpg "Traditional breakfast in Essaouira")

Essaouira wakes up slowly. Let the peaceful atmosphere wash over you, on a terrace, in front of a hot cup of tea or a nos-nos (half expresso, half milk) and msemmen (Moroccan pancake), with amlou (delicious local speciality consisting of a mixture of roasted almonds, honey and argan oil).

### **9 AM Essaouira by the sea**

For a stunning view over the sea, head to the Sqala of the Kasbah and the ramparts guarded by impressive canons. Built in the 18th century by engineer Théodore Cornut, they have been used as the set for several films, including “Othello” by Orson Welles and the serie “Game of Thrones”. The little city is reminiscent of a Breton port in France, thanks to its fortified walls, its port of trawlers and its seagulls.

### **10 AM A stroll in the medina**

The multi-coloured medina reminds you that you are indeed in Morocco. The bright blue of the doors and shutters are met by the brilliant colours of the pottery and rugs, as well as the paintings of “singular artists”, the nickname giver to the self-taught painters of Essaouira, exposed in art galleries. The wonderful aroma of thuja is everywhere, the species is endemic to the region just like argan, which is used to produce an exquisite oil for skin. A must-buy to bring home with you.

### **1 PM Grilled food in the port**

Nothing beats the fish market for a lunch of fresh seafood. After making your buys, sit down in one of the little restaurants and watch as the fish is grilled right in front of you. Simple but delicious.

### **4 PM A** camel **ride along the beach**

Go for a wander, on foot or on camelback, while digesting your lunch. Let your imagination drift away to the sound of the wind and the waves lapping at the [beach ](/en/destinations/enjoy-the-incredible-experience-of-visiting-the-moroccan-beaches/ "Beaches of Morocco")as far as the eye can see. You’re guaranteed to relax.

### **7 PM Sunset**

In the evening, head to a terrace above Taros, Il Mare or other cafes on Moulay El Hassan Square to watch the sun set and the night sweep over Essaouira.

### **9 PM To the sound of Gnawas**

Gnawa music resigns supreme over the night in Essaouira. To discover its enthralling rhythms, head to the Café des Arts (very simple food) or Aigue Marine, which regularly organize free concerts (groups performing live music alternate with DJs).

## · **Second Day**

### **10 AM Surfer Breakfast**

The Panoramique and the Café Resto Océan Vagabond let you enjoy breakfast with your feet in the water before you follow the kite-surfers and wind-surfers onto the waves.

### **12 PM Cooking Class**

For an introduction to the subtleties of the cuisine of Essaouira, head to Atelier Madada or Khadija’a Kuzina. With the chef’s advice, you’ll produce delights that you can savour right there.

## **3 PM Quad in Cap Sim**

The big sand dunes of Cap Sim are the perfect starting point for a quad ride in the hinterland. You’ll cross Oued Ksob and the ruins of the Sultan’s Palace before reaching a marvelous beach.

### **7 PM Peaceful evening**

![Hotel Heure Bleue Palais](/uploads/15578241.jpg "Hotel Heure Bleue Palais")

Before leaving the town, immerse yourself in the chic and warm atmosphere of the Heure Bleue Palais for a touch of nostalgia. A precious moment spent with coffee on the patio or a cup of English tea in the library.
