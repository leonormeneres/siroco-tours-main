Located on the Atlantic coast and surrounded by the plain of the Chawiya, the city enjoys a magnificent climate tempered all year. With a cosmopolitan and westernized environment, it is the modern face of Morocco, and considered the economic capital. Also famous for the movie "Casablanca" which stars Ingrid Bergman - anyway, ironically, the film was not made in Casablanca.

Despite this detail, the city, which gives name to the plot, has a cafe that revives history: Rick's Cafe. To feel the weather soon, we can start with it.

The setting begins with "As Time Goes By", the classic song of the film, condensed by an exquisite decoration that does not leave unnoticed the famous piano. It has a romantic feel, the movie always passing on a television in depth, and games and cards available. The sensation is unforgettable for movie lovers, film lovers, or even anyone who comes in and feels the magnificent weather built. To top it off, there are also live music concerts in the cafe.

If the internal environments are lovely, the external ones are breathtaking. The beaches of Casablanca are not to be missed. The city is facing the sea, and it is possible to take delicious sunbathing and enjoy the waters.

Finally, after a coffee, the walk, and the beach, we can visit cathedral of Notre Dame de Lourdes in Casablanca. From the outside, the church is nothing special to discover, but once inside, its architectural artifact will immediately capture the visitor's attention - the stained glass windows can effectively take your breath away.

Built in 1954 by the French, Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes Church is one of the few places of Catholic worship in a predominantly Muslim country. More than 800 square meters of stained glass are offered to the eyes of visitors amazed. Directed by Gabriel Loire, one of the greatest French glassmakers, they are distinguished by finely worked details and a plethora of colors.

To end the day and this incredible visit, you can opt for the already mentioned and seaside, Hassan II Mosque. It's special, the only one in the world that has free access for non-Muslims, with only guided tours. The mosque is built near the Medina of Casablanca, and over its minaret there is a laser beam in the direction of Mecca. The interior is splendid: 76 pillars support a gigantic painted cedar ceiling that can be opened, allowing the sky to be reflected in the water of the patio.

It's time to relax and internalize everything this trip has given you. All that is left now is waiting for the dusk on the outside terrace and watching as the sun meets the sea.
