If you are visiting Essaouira, you should know that, in the past, it was called Mogador. The city belongs to the southwest coast of Morocco, capital of the homonymous province, which is part of the Marrakech-Tensift-Al Haouz region.

The culture and tourism in Essaouira can be very well taken advantage of. It is in the city that the world-famous music event, the [Gnawa Music Festival](/en/blog/morocco-to-the-rhythm-of-the-gnaoua-festival/ "Gnawa Music Festival"), takes place. You can also discover the local crafts: the jewelery; working the tuia wood, or tasting [Argan Oil](/en/blog/argan-oil/ "Argan oil"), used in the kitchen and in cosmetics.

When we talk about food, Essaouira has a very specific path. Being on the seafront planted, its major specialties are fish dishes, cooked in various ways. We can always enjoy eating grilled fresh fish.

But before starting, Essaouira wakes up slowly. While letting the city's peaceful atmosphere bathe you on a terrace, you'll love to know what to eat to start the day. Standing in front of a hot cup of tea or a nos-nos (for us half coffee, half the milk) and msemmen (Moroccan pancake), with amlou (delicious local specialty consisting of a mixture of toasted almonds, honey and argan), we tell you exactly what a breakfast is here - both in Essaouira and in the whole of Morocco.

## **Moroccan coffee**

It is not common to Morocco the coffee culture that many countries in the Middle East have. Coffee is not usually a breakfast drink, although it is common to see men drinking coffee in the middle of the morning. For Moroccans, drinking coffee means pulling a chair in a cafe and sitting for a while - Morocco has a coffee culture reminiscent of Europe, friends sit outside for hours sipping their Arabic coffee as they swap stories and engage in a friendly beater over riddle games. You will not see a Moroccan standing in a bar and drinking coffee, nor would he see them walking around with a cup of coffee in his hand.

In Morocco, there are two basic types that you can order. The cafe noir, which is a small cup of espresso. Or the Nous nous, which means half and half. It's half the milk and half the espresso - is called nouss nouss or kahwa hleb.

Remember to savor the Moroccan culture. Take a deep breath and think that coffee here is not something to be swallowed. It's to be felt. Pause, do not hurry. Enjoy the scenery of Essaouira.

And do not forget! When traveling to Morocco, make sure to plant yourself in some outdoor cafes to have a full Arabian coffee and coffee experience in Morocco.

## **The msemmen**

M'semen or Msemen (mesamen, musamen, also called malawi, malawah or murtabak) is a traditional pancake, common to the Maghreb region (specifically Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia). The original name is derived from the Arabic word samn or smen, meaning "clarified butter", because it is a substantial ingredient to prepare the bread. One of the varieties of the name, the so-called Malawi, is made from pulling the mass into filaments and forming a disc and comes from North Africa.

In really, Msemmen is essentially the Moroccan fried bread. Typically, they are made two times a day: for breakfast or in the mid-afternoon for coffee time. You will find both a sweet and savory version of these:

The sweet version is topped with melted butter and honey. While the savory version is stuffed with spices and fat and cooked making something akin to a pizza or Indian paratha. It is usually a follow-up to a cup of aromatic morning tea or coffee but can also be stuffed with vegetables or meat fillings.

## **Amlou**

![Moroccan amlou jam](/uploads/traditional-moroccan-almond-amlou-almonds-argan-oil-honey-white-background-73954041.jpg "Moroccan amlou jam")

Amlou is often called the "Moroccan Nutella", as the comparison of amlou with peanut butter is common, but their manufacture and materials are different. But leave room in your suitcase for the oil of Argan, one of the main specialties of Essaouira. That's the main difference that makes Amlou so special. [Argan oil](/en/blog/argan-oil/ "Argan Oil"), which is only found in Morocco, comes from the tree of Argania Spinosa, which manages to live on land with little water. The oil is famous for its use in cosmetics but is also quite useful in cooking.

There are several types of amlou, which contain, among other ingredients, peanuts, sugar and normal oil. The most expensive is made only with almonds, honey and argan oil.

One can buy amlou pots at any large and medium supermarket in Morocco. There are several brands, but check the ingredients before buying, as the most delicious are the most natural.
