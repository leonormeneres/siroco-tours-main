**Find out what to do on Moroccan land, getting to know some of the main sights**

Morocco is a unique country. Located at the junction of Islamic and European cultures and inhabited by ancient Arab and Berber tribes, it is on the border of the largest desert in the world and the greenest mountains of Africa. This rather small area can boast of a wide variety of sights: wonderful beaches of the Atlantic coast and rocky cliffs of the Mediterranean coast, the snow of the High Atlas surrounded by cedar forests and evergreen oak forests, picturesque gorges of mountain rivers, numerous cultural monuments, centuries-old traditions, as well as magnificent souvenirs of local masters.

### **The city of Marrakech**

Marrakech is Morocco's most vivid and dramatic city, the country's cosmopolitan center, nurtured under multiple influences, notably Berber cultures, Andalusian Arabs, Africans and Europeans. Its vibrant and exotic light, the intoxicating aroma of spices, its relaxed and cosmopolitan soul, simple and abundant, covert and sensual, make Marrakech the most fascinating and sought-after city in Morocco.

The old town was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985, and offers a combination of gastronomic delights of exotic spices, refreshing music, ethnic eccentricity trade, opulent gardens and amazing architecture. There is no other city in Africa where one can navigate a hundred-year-old mercantile medina, crossing oblique alleys, through donkey-laden burrows, then into a modern lounge-restaurant, and where the ubiquitous buzz of foreign markets intertwine with the sound of music of the most modern DJs.

### **The “enchanted labyrinth protected from time” called Fes**

![Fes medina at dusk](/uploads/elcarito-3ioRmMDZJNw-unsplash.jpg "Fes medina at dusk")

Justifying this phrase written by the composer Paul Bowles, the city was classified as UNESCO heritage due to its sinuous Medina, numerous monuments and unique culture.

The Medina of Fes is the largest medieval Medina of the Maghreb, retaining its original design since the 12th century. This city, full of memories of a civilization that once stood for tolerance and commerce, is historically a pole of knowledge in North Africa.

Fes is composed of lush gardens, formerly irrigated by the "20 thousand fountains", palaces in detail ornamented, with mosques and Madrasa of faustous but fine decoration and by mysterious alleys. The whole city is sublime and dreamlike, in which different generations cross to share their history full of heroism, and unique atmosphere, in what is also nicknamed "the most imperial of imperial cities”.

### **The blue city of Chefchaouen**

Only in this small town can the eyes rest from the traditional variegation of Moroccan houses. Chefchaouen is a unique place located on the slopes of the Rif Mountains. It simultaneously resembles a European city and a quiet hamlet, with the old buildings that are painted in all sorts of heavenly shades.

The history of painting houses dates back to the 15th century, when Jews arrived in Morocco. Chefchaouen became a place where the Jewish community found its refuge from persecution. During the time they stayed, they managed to leave a memory of themselves, repainting the buildings in blue - the sacred color to them. The Jews moved out, and the tradition took root, making Chefchaouen a recognizable town.

Chefchaouen’s well-preserved medina with its winding streets is a jewel among the Andalusian Arab cities of northern Morocco. To see the city in all its glory, it is necessary to climb the Rif mountain, to see the color transiting from blue to turquoise.

### **On the south Moroccan, Essaouira**

Essaouira is in Atlantic coast, with its completely preserved medina and impressive fortifications it is one of the most beautiful places by the Atlantic Ocean.

Essaouira has European, Jewish and Moroccan features. In the 18th century Essaouira became an important port, and its Medina is designed according to the urban planning principles of European military architecture. This unique character and the preservation of the fortifications and old ramparts, where still can be seen the original Portuguese artillery pieces, as well as the primordial church built there, have earned Essaouira the UNESCO World Heritage award. It famous for its cuisine based on fish and argan, for its temperate climate, extensive beaches and as a musical and artistic center.

### **The Berber Villlage, Merzouga**

Merzouga is near the border of the desert, which sometimes comes to be invaded by the sands.

The desert near Merzouga is famous for its high dunes, traditional Berber camps where only camels and 4 × 4 vehicles arrive with ease. Several activities can be done in the desert of Merzouga, such as sandboard, motorcycle rides through the dunes, therapeutic sand baths, among others.

Near Merzouga there are other small villages, although they are not of easy access as is Merzouga. Among them are the villages where it is possible to contact Berbers who still make even today a nomadic life away from the usual tourist sights.

### **Ait Benhaddou**

Located at the foot of the High Atlas, the Ksar Ait Benhaddou is a UNESCO heritage fortress and the most important point on the route of the "Thousand Kasbahs", a collection of fortifications formerly used to protect caravans on their route between the desert and Marrakech.

Its architecture is a representative example of the architectural style of the northern Saharan zone, using as a building material the earth mixed with clay intertwined with bits of straw.

The most impressive Ksar of Morocco has been the backdrop for historical films in recent decades. For the movie "Jesus of Nazareth" a large part of Aït Benhaddou was rebuilt. Aït Benhaddou became known for his inclusion in the list of World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in 1987 and as a film set, in "Gladiator", "Prince of Persia" and more recently in the series "Game of Thrones".

### **The fertile hart of Morocco, Ziz Valley**

In the south of Morocco, at the gateway to the desert, the Ziz valley has been for years one of the sites that allowed the country to supply agricultural products.

The diversity of the landscapes, the ethnic diversity, the exceptional light, the Leafy and delicate nature, gross and harmonious make this place one of the most charming of Morocco. The existence of an oasis of the size of the Ziz valley is only permitted due to the existence of abundant water in the subsoil. In antiquity, Ziz was designated not only a valley but also a river that began in the atlas and sank to the sands of the desert.

Going through this valley is anadventureand palm groves a labyrinth. Enjoy the hospitality of the Berber people of this oasis a
