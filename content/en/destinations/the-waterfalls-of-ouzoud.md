The Waterfalls of Ouzoud, of the river el-Abid stand around 110m high and they are the largest and most spectacular in North Africa. They are found in the center of Morocco, in the transitional mountainous region between the Middle Atlas and the High Atlas. The nearest town is Aït Attab, near the villages of Ouzoud and Tanaghmeilt, in the province of Azilal. The waterfalls are a few kilometers southwest of the Upper Atlas Mountains National Park, 120km southwest of Beni Mellal and 150km northeast of [Marrakech](/en/destinations/nightlife-in-marrakech/ "Nightlife in Marrakech").

One of the natural wonders of the world - arguably the greatest paradise in Morocco - the Ouzoud Waterfalls are a collection of huge waterfalls in the northeast of the country.

Although there is a short distance between Marrakesh and the Ouzoud Waterfalls, the journey takes almost three hours. In order to spend a full day at the waterfalls, we recommend leaving Marrakesh early. But the journey is worth the trouble - visiting the waterfalls is an incredible and unforgettable experience.

The waterfalls are in the mountainous region between the Middle and High Atlas, at the border of the High Atlas National Park - about 150 kilometers from Marrakesh. It is considered to be one of the ten best waterfalls in the world.

The water falls into the Wadi el-Abid gorge and it is certainly a place you will never forget.The cascades - made up of a series of waterfalls - are wider on top than below.

The waterfalls are the biggest tourist attraction in the region for many reasons. For one, they are home to an endangered species that is native to the area: the Gibraltar monkey, found only in certain places in the Atlas Mountains – other than some small dispersed populations in Algeria and Gibraltar.

Another interesting feature is the valley below the waterfalls, where you can find a hidden natural pool that is only visible at the end of the path, surrounded by olive trees after several forests, orchards and fruit stands of local [berbers](/en/blog/what-do-you-know-about-the-berber-people/ " What do you know about the Berber people?").

It’s recommended to take your bathing suit, as you can soak your feet in the natural pool, bathe and enjoy quiet boat trips. The olive trees in this valley give the name to the waterfalls - "ouzoud" means "olive" in the Berber [language](/en/blog/moroccan-words-you-need-to-know/ "Moroccan words you need to know ").

There are also other tourist attractions nearby: **The Canyon of Oued El Abid** and the so-called "Mexican village." The gorge is about 600 meters deep and upstream of the gorges, **El-Abid river** feeds the large **Bin el Ouidane** dam, located on the other side of the national park.

The "Mexican village" - or more correctly, the "Berber village" - is accessible by paths with semi-subterranean stretches. The Abid Valley is also popular for its hiking trails.

At the top of the mountain, waterways have been placed that help divert the water to run old mills.

There are also manmade contributions that add to the natural beauty. The three, layered falls are especially notable for the fact that they are wider at the top than the bottom and create an immense visual impact.

During the summer, you can see locals jumping into the water from high altitudes. After a day of adventure, take a break to drink mint tea and a have typical Berber lunch. There are restaurants overlooking the waterfalls, where you can taste the traditional [Moroccan cuisine](/en/blog/9-typical-moroccan-foods/ "9 Typical Moroccan Foods ") made especially for tourists. It is the perfect place for a leisurely lunch.

After lunch, it’s a good idea to walk along the rails around the valley; a quiet, peaceful wander in nature.

Despite the summer heat in surrounding areas, this spot is a cooler, more manageable micro-climate.

Take the chance to have a chat and enjoy the company of the friendly Gibraltar monkey!
