The Portuguese city of Mazagan, now El Jadida, is in Morocco, on the west coast of Africa, south of [Casablanca](/en/destinations/casablanca/ "Casablanca").

Mazagan was under Portuguese rule between 1506 and 1769 and was the last possession of Portugal in Morocco, so it contemplates so many remnants of Portuguese culture between its localities. A guide can explain the story with propriety.

In short, it was founded by the Portuguese in the early 16th century as a commercial and military warehouse on the sea route to India. The city remained in possession of the crown until it was conquered definitively by the Moroccans.

At times, it seems that Portugal will never leave El Jadida, although the walled area was later "turned into Jewish quarters". Inside the fortress of El Jadida, there are also typical Portuguese streets, a Portuguese church, an incredible cistern in Manueline gothic style and a fortress well preserved left by the passage of the Portuguese until the mid-eighteenth century.

It now possible to spend a night in an old Portuguese Church, now restored and converted to tourism.

### **What to do in El Jadida?**

In terms of tourism, the city is known mainly for the great Portuguese citadel - known locally as the Cité Portugaise, - the largest of its kind in North Africa.

Visit the El Jadida Synagogue. Over time, it has become a sign of purification, although it has not, therefore, removed the space of other places of worship. So much so that the beautiful Portuguese church is at the head of the mosque. Muslims, Moroccan Jews, and other nationalities cohabited on the walls.

**Church of Our Lady of the Assumption, dedicated to the former patroness of the village.**

You will see the Association Cité Portugaise, an association of residents inside the fortress who tries to contribute to the preservation of the Church. Soon you will also see the longed-for Portuguese Cistern, the first great goal visible on the streets of Mazagan.

The Portuguese Cistern will surprise you. The extraordinary space was originally a weapons depot, and only later (around 1541) it was converted into a cistern to supply the Medina of Mazagan with fresh and potable water.

The cistern has a beautiful set of columns and arches reflected in the layer of water that covers the floor, providing an environment of a certain calm and tranquility that invite you.

The fortress, founded in 1541, is the first example of European military architecture erected outside Europe, having influenced Portuguese squares later built in North Africa. It has the shape of an irregular quadrilateral, topped by four fronts. Two of the faces are facing the coast and two facing the land axis, which reflects the imminently military and defensive character of the construction.

There is also the square, where were several assistance equipment such as the hospital, the granaries, the governor's palace, the warehouses, the cistern, the fountain, churches and hermitages.
