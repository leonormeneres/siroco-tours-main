Fes is a true gem of Arab-Spanish civilization. Like other Moroccan cities, it also has its oldest neighborhood, the Medina, which consists of two parts: old and new. The ancient Medina of Fes-el-Bali was founded in the 11th century - she is already over a thousand years old. The new one, Fes-el-Jedid, was born in the 14th century - it is only about 700 years old.

Visiting the medina means wandering around in its intricate maze, letting yourself be carried away by curiosity, being transported by colors and smells. There are those who sell spices and flour, those who work iron or manufactures handmade fabrics, those who sell street food - of all kinds and tastes.

**Fes-el-Bali** attracts a huge number of tourists. In the shadow of numerous streets hidden small shopping benches and workshops of artisans. The facades and doors of some houses have an amazing finish, made in the form of lace wood carvings, bright mosaics and arabesques.

The medina of Fez is best explored on foot, but you must be careful not to get lost in the narrow streets. The main entrance leads through the magnificent **Bab Bou Jeloud**, the city gate of Fes decorated with blue mosaics.

### **Talaa Kebira and Talaa Seghir - Street of crafts in Medina of Fes**

The **Talaa Kebira** is one of the two major roads that crisscross the Fes of Medina and is lined on both sides with commercial and craft businesses. Here there are still trades that have long been extinct elsewhere, such as [tanners](/en/destinations/the-famous-tanneries-of-fez/ "The famous Tanneries of Fez") or dyers. The furs of goats, sheep and camels still process as in the Middle Ages. The end products such as shoes, bags or lamps can be purchased directly on site. In addition, there are elaborate mosaics and other crafts treasures. Other craft shops can be visited in the Kairaouine quarter or in the tanner's quarter.

Fez el Bali offers fantastic impressions of the world of Thousand and One Nights. A walk through this oriental treasure is like walking through a fascinating open-air museum of magnificent mosques, palaces and lively souks. There are no cars, only motorcycles rattle through the winding streets. Otherwise, people and goods are transported with the help of mules and donkeys.

Walking along **Talaa Seghir**, a busy street where people usually like to shop, you come to the heart of Medina. **Talaa Seghir** eventually reunites with **Talaa Kebira** - she also leads to the al-Karaouine mosque (al-Karaouiyin). Here, street shopping tents and souvenir shops are literally strung on each other, and not far from the intersection of streets on the right side is the bough of carpenters with ready-made furniture for sale.

### **Al Karaouine Mosque and University**

![ Al Karaouine University ](/uploads/University_of_Al_Qaraouiyine.jpg " Al Karaouine University ")

Founded in 859 by Fatima al-Fihri, a native of Tunisia, Al Karaouine University quickly became the foremost spiritual and pedagogical center of the Muslim world at that time. It was incorporated into the University System of Morocco in 1963 and is recognized by the Guinness Book of Records and UNESCO as the oldest university in the world.

The Al-Karaouine Mosque, which is part of the university, is one of the largest mosques in Africa, housing up to 22,000 worshipers. Unlike other magnificent mosques such as the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul or the Bibi-Chanum Mosque in Uzbek Samarkand, the Al-Karaouine Mosque is rather simple, with white columns, a simple facade and bast mats instead of precious rugs.

![Square of Nejarine](/uploads/_Fes-el-Bali5.jpg "Square of Nejarine")

Next to it is the **square of Nejarine**, considered the most beautiful within the old city with a fountain built in the 17th century. There is also a museum of art and crafts with interesting exhibits - historical furniture, musical instruments.

After passing through **Talaa Seghir** and turning to the right, you come to **Souk** **el** **Henna**. In a small area, along with numerous souvenirs and ceramics, cosmetic products and, of course, henna, for tattooing.

Having surrendered to the power of the human stream, "floating" through **Tallaa Kebir,** very soon you feel that you are making a trip to the Middle Ages. In any case, the architectural landscape has not changed at all since that time. A few minutes later you can see the **Madrasa Bu Inania**.

### **Madrasa Bou Inania**

![Madrasa Bou Inania](/uploads/1599px-Bou_Inania_Madrasa,Fes.jpg "Madrasa Bou Inania")

Madrasa Bou Inania also dates back to the 14th century. It served as a school and was once the main mosque of Fes. The founder of the madrassa Sultan Abu Inan Faris wanted to build a school of the Koran, which was supposed to be surpass the beauty and size of all those who had for that period. Together with the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca, it is one of the few Islamic places of worship in Morocco that may also be entered by non-Muslims. After extensive restoration work (1995-2004), you can now admire many wonderful works - luxurious mosaics, wooden carvings.

Opposite the madrasa, a small alley branches off, where there is a house with a hydraulic clock - as they say, the only ones in the world.

### **Dar al-Magana**

![Dar al-Magana](/uploads/Horloge_de_fez.jpg "Dar al-Magana")

Just opposite the Madrasa Bou Inania is the Dar al-Magana ("Clock House"), which is connected to the Madrasa School, named after the Dar al-Magana water clock, built in 1357 by the Merinid Sultan Abu Inan Faris. Due to the continuously decreasing water level, a window opened on the hour meter every hour on the water meter and a metal ball fell into a shell - the remains of the roof, which protected this mechanism, still stick out of the wall as a bar.

### **Al Attarine Madrasa**

![The patio in Al-Attarine Madrasa](/uploads/Al-Attarine_Madrasa_(8753521539).jpg "The patio in Al-Attarine Madrasa")

The Al-Attarine Madrasa was built in the early 14th century by the Marinid Sultan Uthman II Abu Said and is a wonderful example of Merinid architecture. The fantastic ornaments on the interior and exterior walls testify to the mastery of the artists and craftsmen of the time. The Al Attarine Madrasa takes its name from the nearby Al-Attarine Souk, where spices and fragrances are sold.

### **Zaouia Moulay Idriss II**

![The mosaic wall of Zaouia Moulay Idriss II](/uploads/Window_to_tomb_of_Moulay_Idriss_II.jpg "The mosaic wall of Zaouia Moulay Idriss II")

The Zaouia Moulay Idriss II is the burial place of Moulay Idriss II, who founded Fes a second time in 810 and ruled until 828. Today he is regarded as the patron saint of Fes. At the end of the 14th century, his body was found at the place where the Zaouia stands today. In 1440, the magnificent mausoleum was completed by the Merinids and since then renovated and modified several times. Today it shines in the typical style of Alaouite architecture from the 18th century. Legend has it that strangers visiting Fes are required to visit the tomb of their patron.

### **Ibn Danan Synagogue**

![ Ibn Danan Synagogue](/uploads/Ibn_Danan_Synagogue,_April_2016.jpg " Ibn Danan Synagogue")

The Ibn Danan Synagogue was built in the 17th century. Through narrow windows, the sunlight penetrates the interior of the synagogue and creates a gentle atmosphere in the Jewish house of worship. The painted wooden ceiling and the typical Moroccan blue tiles create a picturesque interior with the light blue-washed pillars. Since the late 19th century, the synagogue has been regularly renovated by the Moroccan Ministry of Culture.

### **40 quarters of traditions and craftsmen**

![Brass shop](/uploads/1280px-Old_medina_fes_nehassine.jpg "Brass shop")

The entire territory of the old medina consists of **40 independent quarters**, each of which has a closed structure and includes its water supply, hammam, mosque and bakery. From one quarter to another you can get through the doors. For security reasons, they were closed for the night in previous years, but today this tradition is observed only on the night from Friday to Saturday.

All the buildings are joined together by slabs, which creates a single integrity of Fes-el-Bali, and only the doors are the connecting link. Also, all the facades are very similar in appearance - the difference is in the interior, which can only be seen through the open doors.

Each quarter has its own craft direction. Tanners quarter is considered the home of the best masters of tanning production, famous throughout the world. Nejjarine is the carpentry of the master, where exquisite works of pottery can be enjoyed in the Carpenters' Souk. Paradise for women will be the Bab smarin areas, where they create the most luxurious jewelry and Bu-Inanya, which is famous to produce henna, here you can decorate yourself with a traditional painting on the body.

In the afternoon, the streets are not crowded, but with the onset of coolness the medina revives, and numerous cafes are filled with the charming and enticing aroma of Moroccan coffee.
