As part of its museum renovation strategy, the National Museum Foundation (FNM) has developed a restoration and rehabilitation project for the Tangier Kasbah Museum. After several months of work, the Museum Kasbah of the Mediterranean cultures is since July 2016 a more welcoming and attractive place, with a new scenography which made it possible to return all their dimension to the presented collections.

## **General presentation**

The Kasbah Museum of Mediterranean Cultures is an important heritage site and an important part of the Mediterranean collective memory. It is also one of the oldest cultural institutions testifying to the richness and diversity of the Mediterranean basin.

It is nestled in the heart of the Kasbah of Tangier, a city that enjoys many geostrategic advantages. This situation gives it the essential role of interface between Africa and Europe, as well as between the two maritime areas that are the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. Previously known as the Kasbah Palace called "Dar Al-Makhzen" or "Palace of the Sultan", the Museum occupies the eastern part of the Kasbah of Tangier. Enjoying a strategic position, the site adjacent to the palace would have been used by the Carthaginians and Romans, as evidenced by the legend that a temple of Hercules once stood there. During the first period of the Muslim occupation, the historical sources speak of a governor installed on the site of the Kasbah Palace of Tangier in the 12th century. However, the archaeological data remain very insufficient to confirm this. Later, this site saw the successive construction of the residence of the Portuguese governors "Domos Praefecti" between 1471 and 1661, then a larger castle "Upper Castle" which was the residence of the English governors from 1662 to 1684.

The palace of the Kasbah is the work of Ahmed Ben Ali, son of Caid Ali Ben Abdellah El Hamani Errifi. A foundation inscription chiseled in the zellige wall covering of the "Qobbat Dar el Bukhari "indicates the date of 1151 of the Hegira, 1737-1738 AD. Since then, this monument constitutes the seat of power and the symbol of local authority. The building has undergone several restructurings during the reigns of Sultans Moulay Slimane and Moulay Hassan I.

## **The collections**

The Kasbah Museum of Mediterranean Culture offers its visitors the discovery of an exceptional exhibition, consisting of archaeological and ethnographic collections that reflect the diversity and specificity of Tangier.

The exhibition unfolds in a flexible way: it is divided into three sections organized according to the architectural route of the Palace. A chronological itinerary enlightened by thematic stops allows visitors to contemplate the beauty of the building, but also to reconstitute, reconstruct and appropriate the history of the city and its interactions with the Mediterranean world.

## **First section**

The visit opens with a focus illuminating archaeological sites rich in museum material and continues with a journey through the most remote epochs of prehistory, in a space entitled the first hunters to the first peasants". The exhibits demonstrate the density and age of the settlement, even during the Lower Palaeolithic (Acheulean), Middle Paleolithic (Mousterian, Azerian) and Epipaleolithic. Neolithization ushered in a new era characterized by the shaping of clay and the polishing of axes. The practice of breeding is well attested by the presence of remains of domestic animals, mussels and pebbles betraying a beginning of agricultural activity.

The visitor is then led to immerse himself in the heart of pre-Roman Mediterranean civilizations with a range of objects illustrating the material history of Tangier and its hinterland; ceramics, terracotta figurines, silver jewels of the Phoenician tradition, amulets, silver necklaces, decorated ostrich eggshells. The next room is devoted to the period of Romanization of the region. A bas-relief depicting a reclining banquet scene and an entablature block evoking the theme of victory through sacrifice are on display. Pieces emblematic of the iconographic diversity of Roman archaeological objects that attest the cultural belonging of Morocco to the great Mediterranean civilization. Afterwards, the exhibition highlights a collection of objects attesting Islamization and the great dynasties that have succeeded each other in Morocco. Visitors can admire the "Koubba K'bira", a large dome decorated with plaster and cedar wood carved and painted. It covers a majestic room, furnished with zelliges and home to a rich collection of illuminations and writing.

See also in this section, verses of poetry that decorate the walls and a beautiful manuscript of Quran XIII th Golden Century and illuminated as well as the collection of prayers "Dalil Al Khairat‚Äù.

A space is also dedicated exclusively to the site of Qsar Sghir, while another addresses the Portuguese occupation and the liberation of Tangier by the Alawites.

## **Second section**

The rest of the tour leads the visitor to discover a section dedicated to material traces informing about the important commercial activities that operated between the Tingitian peninsula and other Mediterranean civilizations.

The floor of the patio is paved with a mosaic from Volubilis "Navigum Veneris", representing the goddess Venus in a marine scene. This exhibition is enriched with exceptional works, including a fish-decorated vase, an Egyptian Ouchebti and an Etruscan Oenochoe.

Evidence of fruitful encounters between Mediterranean civilizations and indigenous peoples, these objects confirm the wealth of the geographical position of the city of Tangier, at the confluence of maritime routes.

## **Third section**

The exhibition ends with a thematic focus on "Religion and funerary rites", thanks to several archaeological witnesses exhumed from the necropolis of the region. In this room, the visitor can contemplate a life-size model of the Mghogha Punic tomb and its accompanying furniture, a burial of a child buried in a jar, lead sarcophagi, incineration urns discovered in the necropolis from Marchan or painted frescoes from the Boukhachkhach necropolis.

Outside the exhibition, the visitor can admire the "Riad As Sultan". This Moroccan-Andalusian-style garden features a fountain. It presents in the open, a lapidary collection (marble capitals, well margins) and guns.
