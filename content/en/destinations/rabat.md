Rabat is located on the magnificent shores of the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the Bou Regreg River and is one of the largest cities in Morocco. The name in translation from medieval Arabic means "Fortress", even if today’s name is a junction of two words “Ribat al-Fath”, meaning "Fortress of Victory". The river Bou-Regreg serves as a link between the capital and the city of Sale, forming a separate agglomeration.

It is a calm and elegant city in which the gardens emerge through its avenues turning the walks into an authentic delight for the senses. Not in vain is it known as "the city of gardens".

## **Rabat: A little history**

![The ancient wall of Rabat](/uploads/monument-to-the-tower-of-hassan-2219058_1280-2.jpg "The ancient wall of Rabat")

**The history** of the city is quite interesting and full of events. From the third century BC it was successively **occupied by Phoenicians, Carthaginians and** finally **Romans** who founded the Sala colony, making it a very important commercial center. Sultan Yakub al-Mansour, who ruled the state in the 12th century, strove to strengthen the maritime borders, having formed the capital of the state in the city of Rabat. To strengthen the coastline, a powerful fortress was built, called **Kasbah of the Udayas**.

But the heyday of the city was not long, after the death of the ruler, the state of Rabat came to a severe decline. In the 17th century, power was captured by **pirates** who connected Rabat and Sale, where a small pirate state was formed, with its own rules and laws. They took advantage of such a successful location for seizing past passing ships.

The rule of the corsairs lasted until the 19th century, until the country fell under the protection of France. In 1956, Mohammed V came to power, who became the first king of Morocco. One of the first decrees was the return of the country's capital to the city of Rabat. From this important historical moment, the city began to actively develop and prosper.

## **Rabat: Some interesting sights**

**The Hassan Tower** was built in the 12th century under Sultan Al-Mansur. The sultan dreamed of building the world's largest mosque so that his entire army could come to prayer. It was planned to build a 90-meter-long minaret, but all plans were never realized. At the time of the death of Sultan Al-Mansur, the altitude was only 44 meters, after which the construction of the mosque stopped. In the following years the building was left to the erosion of time, which was also helped by the 18th century earthquake.
