Historically, Agadir once was a village sustained by the commerce of the sea. Today, it is a modern touristic city.

Agadir is a city in the south of Morocco situated north of the mouth of the Suz River, on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. It is the capital of the Souss-Massa-Drâa region. The name means "wall", "fortress" or "city" in Berber. The three most common spoken languages are tashelhit (the first language of the majority), Moroccan Arabic and French.

After an earthquake in 1960, Agadir was rebuilt away from the epicenter. This transformed the city completely: wide avenues, buildings with modern [architecture](/en/blog/moroccan-architecture/ "Moroccan Architecture "), beachfront resorts and golf courses were built, attracting thousands of tourists.
