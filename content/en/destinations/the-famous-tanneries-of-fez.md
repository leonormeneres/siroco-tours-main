The spiritual capital of Morocco, Fez, is endowed with a diversity in the artisanal field. One of the tourist attractions of Fez is without a doubt its tanneries, a colorful ancestral stage of Moroccan craftsmanship, undisputedly renowned for its reputation throughout the world and its markets.

The city was crowded with a large number of tanning houses two centuries ago. It was home to thousands of workers and craftsmen, whose work ranged from buying cattle skins, cleaning them, painting them in bright colors, and creating leather products that fascinated tourists and customers.

As time passes, among the dozens of tanning houses, few have been able to maintain its continuity. The souk of fez is home to three ancient tanneries, that are distributed in different districts, but always in the immediate vicinity of water sources. Indeed, the use of water is essential for the supply of ponds and for the dumping of residues. The largest and oldest being the Chouara (Chaouwara) Tannery, which is nearly a thousand years old.

### **The work of leather**

Each step described corresponds to a part of the process, a system that is practically preserved as in antiquity and usually inherited from father to son.

The skins are firstly bought from the butchers: usually camel, goat, cow or sheep. After being roughly cleaned, they will be placed in the vats filled with lime, cowâ€™s urine, and salt. This process has two purposes: on the one hand, to finish eliminating everything that is not skin itself, such as extra fat, hair and flesh, and on the other hand, to give it firmness. Then the skins will be reviewed to be removed all that remaining flesh or hair that is still attached.

At that time the process of "cleaning" the skin will be finished, and what will continue will aim to give it additional properties, such as softness and color. The skins will be submerged in the other vats containing pigeon droppings to give it softness, after which the tanners tread on the skins with their bare feet for hours - a laborious process, to make the skins softer and more malleable.

When it comes to dyeing, the vats turn into color palettes. The dyeing process is done using natural substances that vary from poppy flower to red, from indigo to blue, from henna to orange, or from mint to green. Finally, the skins are rinsed and then dried in the sun for three days. The leather is now ready to be sent to craftsmen who will turn it into clothes, bags, slippers or wallets.

It is a process that leaves no one indifferent. It is such a hard work, withstanding the smell and dizziness, so no one can even imagine what it must be to work from sunrise to sunset, day and day, in that square. No wonder the tanning trade is recognized as the hardest in Morocco.

### **View of the tanneries**

To admire such a process, you can go up to the leather goods stores, which have terraces at a considerable height where you can observe the entire process in detail.

Look at the tanners and discover a lot of vats of all colors. At the same time you will perceive an intense smell and instinctively bring the sprig of mint that you have offered to your nose. Observe, in silence and with absolute respect, all the men who bend, removing the skins from one vat to another, diligent in their work.

You will be fascinated by the spectacle it represents and the feeling of having traveled through time.
