## **General presentation**

The palace of Dar Si Said was built during the second half of the 19th century by the minister of war Si Said B. Moussa. In 1930, under the French Protectorate the palace is transformed into a museum of Indigenous Arts, and hosts workshops of artisans demonstrating their traditional techniques.

After independence, the offices of Dar Si Said were divided between the craft department and the museum. The latter occupies half of the palace, including the large Riad with its four rooms, the small Riad, two floors and many annexes. This part of the palace has a typical architecture of the nineteenth century Moroccan, and is a beautiful testimony of this architectural era, both in its structure that its decor.
