Merzouga is a small Berber village in the Sahara desert about 35 km from Rissani, 40 km from Erfoud, and about 20 km away from the border with Algeria. Despite its size, Merzouga benefits from tourism and receives much of the country's tourists.

After Marrakech, Merzouga is perhaps the most visited place in Morocco. The main factor is not the village itself, but the walk that can be done coming out of it. It is in Merzouga that the famous camel ride is made, with the right to camp in the middle of the Sahara desert. Merzouga is known as the main base for those going to the Sahara Desert. The vicinity of Merzouga already begin to give you the vision of immense dunes, with warm tones.. The dunes extend for 50km, reaching almost the border with Algeria.

In Merzouga, meals are served with typical, delicious Moroccan tea that is always present. Most people come from Berber tribes, and you can find people speaking practically any language, from Spanish, to English, French, Italian, Portuguese and even asian languages like Japanese and Chinese.

The activities at your disposal depend on what time you will visit Merzouga. In the mildest days you can enjoy the structure and spend the day there, doing nothing in the camp. Everything is simpler, with easier walks. Closer to summer, when the temperature exceeds 40 degrees on the dunes, all you will want is a pool, which is even possible in many hotels. If you choose this option, you can simply wait for the sun to rise to start exploring. In winter the days are nicer, but it is quite cold at night. **Luckily, now-a-days, touristic nomadic camps in the desert have heating.** Those luxury camps are the one we use in the tours we plan for our clients.

Around the dunes there are other lesser known villages, but worth a visit, such as Hassilabied at 4km, Tanamoust at 3km, Takoujt at 1.5km, Khamlia at 7km and Tisserdmine at 15km.
