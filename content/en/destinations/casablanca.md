الدارالبيضاء_Ad- Dar al-Beida_ in Arabic, or as Moroccan call it, _Casa_, literally "the white house" - in Spanish -  is the cosmopolitan, industrial and economic heart and the largest city of Morocco, the third largest in Africa, after Cairo and Johannesburg.

Unlike Marrakech or Fes and other Moroccan cities, Casablanca strikes with its **absolute modernity**. In recent years, thanks to large-scale town-planning projects, the city has completely changed its appearance. At least in those parts visited by foreign tourists, the city is represented by wide neat boulevards framed by palm trees, huge glowing billboards, luxury hotels, in general, **without eastern stereotypes**. It is said that the number of buildings in the Art Deco style of Casablanca can compete with Miami.

This city has a great weight in the history of the humanity because here realized, in 1943, **the transcendental meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, in which the invasion of Day D to Europe was decided**. The secret services of Hitler were deceived and believed that this would take place in the White House in Washington and not in **Casablanca, Morocco**.

The city of Casablanca was founded by fishermen by Berbers in the 10th century BC, later belonged to the Phoenicians, and the Romans. In the Berber Mérenid dynasty (Banu Merin), which ruled Morocco in the 13th and 16th centuries, Casablanca was an important **strategic port** under the name **Anfa**. The Portuguese destroyed it in 1468 and built it in 1558 under the name of **Caza Branca** (White House). But after the devastating earthquake that happened in 1755, they abandoned the city. The Moroccan sultans rebuilt the city, and it began to be called **Spanish Casablanca**, thanks to Spanish merchants who founded their trading bases in the city.

The French occupied the city in 1907. Since 1912 Casablanca was a French protectorate when the construction of the " ville nouvelle " (a new city) began. Together with the rest of the country, Casablanca became independent in 1956.

**Casablanca is the largest city in Morocco** with a population of almost 4 million inhabitants and also **has the largest artificial port in the world**, although it has no ferry service of any kind. Casablanca is also the most liberal and progressive city in Morocco. Designer brands are the norm in the wealthy neighborhoods of the city and much of the Moroccan youth speaks exclusively in French.
