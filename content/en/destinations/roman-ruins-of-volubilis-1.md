**Volubilis are the best-preserved Roman ruins in this part of North Africa.**

Volubilis, word from Arabic is Oualili or Walila, is a site of archaeological complex derived from the ruins of what was once a Roman city. This partially excavated archaeological site is in the north of Morocco, in the north-western outskirts, just 4 kilometers away, from the holy town of [Moulay Idris](/en/destinations/the-sacred-city-moulay-idriss/ "The sacred city Moulay Idriss"), to the north although only 33 kilometers away from [Meknes](/en/destinations/meknes/ "Meknes"), between [Fez](/en/destinations/fez/ "Fez") and [Rabat](/en/destinations/rabat/ "Rabat"). In 1997, the site was listed as a [World Heritage Site by UNESCO](/en/blog/unesco-in-morocco/ "UNESCO in Morocco"). Internationally, it became known when Martin Scorsese filmed "The Last Temptation of Christ" in 1988.

The origin of the city name is a controversial subject. According to the philologist Felix Gaffiot (1870-1937), who uses the name Völubïle, volubilis, means "that has a rotating movement" in Latin. The name of the Berber designates the bell-shaped (convolvulaceae) or aloendro plants or their flowers, particularly abundant on the banks of the Khoumani Wadi, and the word Volubilis may have resulted from the Latinization of that word. The city is relatively little mentioned in ancient and medieval sources.

**The archaeological site is in the Moroccan administrative region of Meknes-Tafilete.**

**The ruins have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list since 1997. Volubilis houses an archaeological site from the 3rd century BC which depicts the period of Roman domination in the region.**

**The classification as a World Heritage is since "it is an exceptionally well-preserved example of a great Roman colonial city in the limits of the empire".**

### **Volubilis History**

![Fertile original site](/uploads/volubilis10.jpg "Fertile original site")

For centuries, Volubilis was a prosperous city of the Roman Empire that developed thanks to the commerce of wheat and other cereals, olive oil from its olive trees and domestic animals and wild animals - also for gladiatorial spectacles - whose exports were made to Rome. This happened because the city is situated in a fertile agricultural plain, indications that can be perceived until today, through the green fields that surround it.

The city was built on a ridge over the Khoumane Wadi near the rocky massif of Zerune, on a plateau slightly inclined at about 390 meters, called the plateau of El Gaada, situated 60 meters below, and under the extensive fertile plain extends north of Meknes.

The plateau rises to 500 to 800 meters of altitude and its sandstone and limestone were used in the constructions of the city. The land is also rich in marls used for pottery and brick. To understand the level of wealth, know that the slopes of Zerune are still used today for grazing cattle and for growing cereals, vineyards and olive groves.

In addition to the fertile sleep capacity, the region's climate is Mediterranean in nature and it benefits from abundant rainfall that supplies springs that ensure enough water is available to supply an urban community of several thousand people.

**Volubilis was the administrative center of his province. It is estimated that in Sec. III its population was about 20,000 inhabitants.**

Originally a Carthaginian settlement, Phoenician-Carthaginian settlement since the early third century BC, its development occurred from this same century, having grown rapidly under Roman rule from the first century BC until occupying an area of ​​approximately 40 hectares, surrounded by walls with 2.6 km of perimeter.

Volubilis was to be transformed into the administrative center of the Roman province of Mauritania Tingitana. In the second century the city was endowed with a series of public buildings, namely a basilica, temples dedicated to the gods and a triumphal arch. Its prosperity propitiated the construction of many rich urban houses, with great floor mosaics. It was the wealth typical of the Roman Empire, with mansions, houses for officers and a center. In the city, the religion practiced was Christianity and Latin the language spoken by its Romans, Greeks, Jews and Syrians.

With the fall of the Roman Empire and after 300 years of constant disputes with the Berbers, the Romans would come out of Morocco. Volubilis was taken by local tribes c. And was never reconquered by Rome. Among other reasons are its remote location and difficult to defend, on the southwest border of the Roman Empire.

It continued to be inhabited for at least another 700 years, first as a Christian Latinized community, and then as an Islamic locality. At the end of the eighth century it became the capital of Idris ibne Abdallah, the founder of the idrid dynasty, the first Muslim state in Morocco.

In the eleventh century, Volubilis was abandoned and the idolized capital was transferred to Fez. Most of its population moved to the new holy city of Mouley Idris, located to the northwest of Volubilis.

**In it you will find several ruins of public buildings of the Roman period, temples, palaces, houses and mosaics.**

The ruins remained practically intact until they were destroyed by the earthquake of 1755, the same that destroyed Lisbon. Shortly afterwards they served as quarry for the construction of Meknes.

It took quite a while: it was not until the end of the 19th century that the place was definitively identified as the ancient city of Volubilis. During and after the French Protectorate of Morocco, about half of the site was excavated, many mosaics were discovered, and some of the most important public buildings and houses were restored or rebuilt.
