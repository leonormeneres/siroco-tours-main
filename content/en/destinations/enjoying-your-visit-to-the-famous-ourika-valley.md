Approximately 30km from [Marrakech](/en/destinations/nightlife-in-marrakech/ "Nightlife in Marrakech"), the Ourika Valley is at the foothills of the High Atlas Mountains, in the Toubkal National Park. Although close to the urban center, this beautiful green valley is one of the best-preserved valleys in Morocco. Travelling along the Ourika River you can admire the landscape of the High Atlas, unique and distinct from those seen in Marrakech.

Ourika Valley is the most famous stretch of the national park, covered by diverse vegetation and many palm trees, waterfalls and mountainous scenery. The valley also contains small [Berber](/en/blog/what-do-you-know-about-the-berber-people/ " What do you know about the Berber people?") villages that gather on the banks of the river which - despite the proximity to the city - preserve much of their ancestral way of life. It is a great example of the beauty, magic and richness of Moroccan nature. The region is perfect for many types of travelers: there are activities for the most energetic people, beautiful discoveries and places to rest and meditate.

The valley is the only habitat in the High Atlas of the Gibraltar monkey (scientifically named _Macaca Sylvanus_ and popularly known as the Berber monkey). Other than the Ourika valley, this endangered species is only found in the Middle Atlas and some small dispersed populations in Algeria and Gibraltar. It is said that during the Second World War - when a possible Spanish-German invasion was feared - the British Prime Minister [Winston Churchill](/en/blog/the-delightful-relationship-between-churchill-and-morocco/ "The delightful relationship between Churchill and Morocco") gave the order to take several dozen Gibraltar monkeys from North Africa to ensure the survival of the dwindling population.
