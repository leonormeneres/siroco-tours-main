The Uzdi Ziz is a river or uid from the south of Morocco that rises in the mountains of the Middle Atlas and joins the Wadi Rheris southwest of Tinfou and Merzouga to form the Daoura, whose waters are lost in the Algerian Sahara.

Counting its extension from the beginning of the stretch with the name of Daoura, the Ziz is 282 km long. In addition, some reference sources the section designated by Daoura river is mentioned as being the Ziz, being that in this way the length of the Ziz increases to 450 km. The Ziz River ends its way in the Dunes of Erg Chebbi, a sea of ​​golden sand and orange with gigantic dunes up to 200m high. Among the localities along its banks, the cities of Errachidia, Erfoud and Sijilmassa stand out for their current or historical importance.

The approximately 80 kilometers of Erfoud, passing through the capital of the province of Er Rachidia to the smaller town of Rich, is along the deep valley of Ziz. Strictly speaking, it follows the contours of the river Ziz, but seeing the river itself on this route is difficult until you pass by Er Rachidia.

**The impressive Ziz Valley is situated between Midelt in the Atlas Mountains and the town of Errachidia in the Sahara Desert.**

At the roadside in the Middle Atlas you will pass through a cedar forest where there are resident monkeys and dogs that are fed by tourists and travelers. After this incredible and exotic experience, one arrives at the edge of the wonderful Oasis of Ziz, where appears one of the largest vineyards in Morocco. The image is impressive and manages to thrill.

Soon the river lies on a large dam. The Addakhill Dam, of the Ziz River, a Pharaonic work to regularize part of the course of the river and to make feasible irrigation projects at this edge of the desert.

The Ziz Valley has rocky landscapes, broken by complex gorges that follow along the Ziz River through the Tafilalet region in southern Morocco until it ends in Algeria. When walking along this long course, the river feeds a series of oases and bringing life to a landscape that would otherwise be land and stone. They are beautiful localities and ecosystems that were born from the existence of these waters.

On the road that leads to the Sahara Desert, heading towards the town of Erfoud, crosses the Middle Atlas Mountains through the magnificent Canyon of the River Ziz. During the road, there are plenty of belvederes to watch the incredible scenery.

The valley is dense with many palms and the river is a lush green wall-to-wall carpeting delimited by the steep and steep walls of the canyon, stretching as far as you can see. Here and there, a wave of smoke rises out of the trees, or a flat patch of emerald-green irrigated field appears where the palms narrow, and then you will be noticing the only signs of human presence that the region initially reserves for you.

The Ziz Valley is one of the zones of the world with more palm trees per square kilometer. To the south, the valley widens, presenting a spectacular sight: a dense canopy of palms wedged between ancient striated cliffs, dating to the Jurassic period. It pays to take the time to explore the rich palms.

In fact, there are many people living in the valley, essentially all farmers, working in the palm groves and in the small vegetable fields between the two. Ziz has fed the population for millennia. Here and there, along the green banks of the River Ziz, come groups of casbás (fortified settlements) built to protect families who lived in the area. From the road that runs through the Ziz Valley you can see many of these fascinating buildings, now no longer inhabited. They were built very close to the river, to be used for it, which makes everything more accessible.

But the ways of life are not unilateral. At the southern end of the Ziz Valley lies Tafilalet, an independent kingdom of Morocco from the 8th to the 10th century. Although the water flow is intermittent, its valley has long been used as a transit route along the mountainous regions that through. The Ziz River, an essential source of water, irrigates the entire region of Tafiltat.

The great wealth of this kingdom is due to the important role it played in the trade of the old caravans that traveled through the Sahara Desert. In this section, the Oasis of Ziz is named Tafilalt and is considered one of the largest in the world. The caravans left Tafilalt and Tombuctu loaded with cloths, weapons and spices and returned with salt, gold and ivory. Caravans took a 60-day journey through the desert dunes to their destination.

The Ziz River passes smaller in the middle of the vineyard. You will travel in the historical importance that the river had when feeding the caravans of merchants that came from the interior of Africa until the coast of Morocco.

The city was founded on the banks of the River Ziz during the period of the French occupation, when it served as a military base for [Berbers](/en/blog/what-do-you-know-about-the-berber-people/ "Berbers") and [Tuareg](Do you know the Tuaregs, lords of the desert? "Tuareg") against the French.

Highlights stand for large, tasty dates. Despite intermittent flow, water is always present underground.

It is the most important of the oases of the Moroccan Sahara, an oasis of over 300 Km long, one of the largest in the world. It has always been a trading site of the "Salt Route" between the north and the southern tip of Morocco. Gold, spices, salt, weapons, cloths, slaves, and ivory passed through it, trading between Black Africa from Sudan, Mali, Niger, and Gulf of Guinea to the Mediderranean.
