If Morocco is the royal family, then Chefchaouen is the sapphire in the crown. A blue village high in the Rif mountains is the gentle side of Morocco not to be missed.

Chefchaouen is a small, picturesque town, full of unique, powderblue houses, of about 40,000 inhabitants in northeastern Morocco near the Mediterranean Sea.

Compared with the chaos of Marrakech and [Fes](/en/destinations/fez/ "Fez"), Chefchaouen is eccentric, quiet and beautiful. Walk past the entrance to medina and you will feel like you have stepped into another world. Every corner has amazing scenery, it is a photographer's dream land.

## **Chefchaouen -- blue history**

Chefchaouen was painted blue by the Jewish refugees in the 1930s. In the contrast to the colourfully painted Chefchaouen, the stiff mountains around become more lively. The blue Chefchaouen architecture is the card of this Moroccan gem, whose unique colors are rooted in history and religion. Jewish history suggests that to be reminded of god's great power, take an ancient, natural dye, "tekhelel," and weaving it into a prayer shawl. The colors of tekhelel are achieved by the blue buildings of Chefchaouen, which are often repainted to ensure the bright colors.

Chefchaouen is also a popular destination to shop local [handicrafts](/en/blog/crafts-of-morocco/ "Crafts of Morocco"), such as woolen wear and woven blankets. Local goat cheese is also popular with tourists. And also, it is one of Morocco's leading producers of cannabis, which is sold throughout the town.

## What to do here?

If you're interested in photography, you can walk down the cobbled streets with a camera in your hand and you will surely be occupied for hours. Walk around the streets and indulge your taste buds by sampling spices and delicacies, from enticing spices and aromatic herbs to delicious freshly baked breads (baked in authentic wood-burning ovens) and traditional tagines.

If you want to do something more active and challenging, there are plenty of places around for hiking.

### **1. Medina**

If you compare the medina of Chefchaouen with the big cities of Morocco, such as Marrakech and Fes, you will find that it is a bit small indeed. However, in this art-filled blue town, you'll find higher-quality products, friendlier neighborhoods and easier alleys to find your way around.

Shopping in medina is not only the best way to interact with locals and appreciate their work, but also a great way to explore the city and its historic buildings. Many visitors to the area say it is the most beautiful part of the city, and it is definitely worth a visit if you are interested in the city's non-architecture or leather (the city's most famous products).

### **2. Kasbah museum**

For those interested in urban culture and history, you can also visit the Kasbah museum after shopping in medina. It is almost in the middle of the labyrinth of the "old town" in the Andalusian gardens. This museum is one of Morocco's most beautiful and well-preserved artefacts, and you are sure to have a deep and rich understanding of the region's history.

The garden is also a great place for peace and tranquility. The view from the top of the tower is amazing.

### **3. Uta el-Hammam Plaza**
