Marrakech is one of the most vibrant destinations in the Arab world, with sophisticated lounge bars and fascinating restaurants housed in ancient traditional mansions, and courtyards in the Medina. Perfect for nightlife lovers, and for some years is one of the most popular destinations of European travelers. It is a city to visit slowly to discover the most hidden corners, get lost in its crowded markets and enjoy the aromas and flavors.

## **Medina**

The nights of the center of Marrakech surprise for people that go out to its streets. During the early hours of the night, the streets of the Medina are a hotbed of people moving from one place to another or take advantage of some of the shops open to buy. Especially _bustling and lively_ are the nights of Ramadan, once the daily fast breaks, when practically all the inhabitants are in the street and it makes a huge contrast with the little activity of the afternoons.

The center of all activity is the **Jamaa el Fna square** and its adjacent streets. In Jamaa el Fna there is a lot of tradition of street shows and it is very normal to find small groups or musicians who offer improvised concerts of traditional music around the groups of curious people who come to them, as well as some other attractive spectacle for the strollers.

In the very center of the square, visible from afar by its lights and the smoke that comes out of its stoves, several dozen mobile restaurants are placed at night where you can dine on Moroccan specialties for good prices. For those who want more formal restaurants, the buildings that surround the square are full of them. By the way, many of them have terraces on their roofs, which allow viewing from the top the entertainment and nightlife of the area.

The neighboring street of **Bab Agnaou** has many hotels that also have restaurant and terrace on its roofs. Among them, the **Sesame Café** stands out for the night, where - besides having dinner - you can enjoy a drink or a smoothie in a magnificent chill-out area of ​​your terrace for a more than reasonable price. It is not normal that alcoholic beverages are served in these terraces, although in some of the most expensive ones they can offer that possibility. Custom dictates that you can not drink alcohol when you have a mosque in sight, so you should always seek to consume it in a rather discreet way.

Another fantastic option to enjoy the night of the Medina is to go into the **souks** and go shopping in the early hours of the night, finding the shops and the streets lit up and in the middle of commercial rush hour.

From 10 o'clock at night, the nightlife of the Medina gradually fades and, after 11 o'clock at night, there are few people left in the streets and the stores are closing little by little.

## **New Area**

The new area of ​​Marrakech has a completely different type of entertainment: more western, less commercial, with fewer people on the street, but more in international bars and restaurants. It is not too difficult to find alcohol in them and, some even have terraces where you can get the beers or the wine on the street. Most of the international cafés and restaurants in this area are concentrated in the areas of the Hassan II and Mohammed V avenues.

To spend a quiet evening and enjoy a great cocktail, **Café Arabe** offers refined and selected cocktails accompanied by briouates - pasta filled with meat or cheese typical of the Moroccan gastronomic tradition. For an evocative atmosphere we recommend you sit on the terrace and enjoy the view and the view of the city.

Learn-to-fire performances, Le Mahal's Band's live music shows featuring the great classics of the 80's are some of the entertainment that animates the evenings of the **Palais Jad Mahal**.

In these areas, nightclubs are also concentrated. Completely Western, but with some peculiarities. Tickets are expensive and - especially on weekends and days with more people - the gatekeepers often demand that it be well arranged to allow access, although they are perhaps somewhat more flexible with foreigners.

## **Alcohol**

It can be relatively easy to buy alcohol to take in the new zone, but almost impossible to do so in the Medina. The best thing to stock up on alcoholic beverages is to go to one of the big hypermarkets in the outskirts, principally Marjane or Carrefour. In them, there is a separate section for alcoholic beverages. It is usually a common spot for expatriates in the area. During Ramadan, these areas remain closed, but if you are not Moroccan you can ask to be opened by presenting your passport. It is advisable to consume alcoholic beverages with some discretion, especially in Ramadan and in certain areas of the city, such as in the Medina or in the vicinity of mosques.

Following are some of the most **popular clubs** in Marrakech.
