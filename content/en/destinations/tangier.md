The first associations that arise from the mention of **Tangier** are the end of the land where the _Strait of Gibraltar_ is merging with the _Atlantic_, the heroic sleep of _Hercules_ before another feat, and the heroine _Tilda Swinton_ walking barefoot in the old medina in the movie _"Only lovers will survive"._

**Tangier**, that eternal city, cradle of the Greek, Roman and Berber **mythology**, has seen parading through its cobblestone streets to conquerors of all times and all nations, men of arms, politicians, diplomats. And under that inimitable light, we remember painters like **_Delacroix_** or **_Henri Matisse_**, artists who captured in their canvases those magical colors of Moroccan land, as well as the immortal works of writers like **_Tennessee Williams_** and **_Paul Bowles_**, who tried to reproduce on paper that ancestral magic of a land so close and so distant at the same time.

By the way, the atmosphere in the film **_"Casablanca"_** was also drawn from Tangier, and even the decorations of Rick's Cafe were created based on the Tangier Hotel El Minzah.

Until the late fifties of the twentieth century there was an independent international territory under the mild political control of France, Spain and Britain. Having obtained independence in 1956, Morocco seized to itself and a tasty northern corner.

Today Tangier is the business center of the north of the kingdom and a transport hub connecting Morocco and Europe. Once a major port now exists only within the maritime station, which accepts ferries with travelers from Spain.

Although tourism is an important part of the city's budget, Tangier can hardly be called a tourist one. It is relatively quiet and nice, just for lovers of urban recreation.

## **The Medina of Tangier**

The old city has not lost the original charm despite having been modified by the great European influence during the last 140 years, by the construction of numerous homes for diplomats and European personnel. It has the charm of Arab medinas and some areas of walls with circular towers of Portuguese origin.

## **The Grand Socco**

The small streets of Medina smoothly pass into the city ​​market. Here in Tangier it is the social heart of the city. The Grand Souk, which must be approached with care, due to the pickpockets, is still the best place to spend time in Tangier, seeing how the vendors trumpet their wares to the four winds. It is also the ideal entry point to reach the Medina.

Among the important places that embrace the square, in addition to the wall and various terraces where you can have a drink, you will find an old cinema called **_"Cinema Rif”,_** nowadays reconverted, bringing together not only its original function, but also offering other spaces like workshops and even a library.

## **The fortress of Kasbah**

![Old fortress of Kasbah](/uploads/Tangier8.jpeg "Old fortress of Kasbah")

This fortress was erected in 1771. They built it, moreover, at the highest point of the city, and the material for the construction was the parts of the structures that were preserved by a miracle from the time of the Roman Empire. In the north of the fortress you can see the observation deck - from there you will have the opportunity to enjoy magnificent views of the Strait of Gibraltar and the mountains already on the opposite coast of Spain.

## **Museums**

Walking through the fortress, you should definitely investigate the [**Musée de la Kasbah** ](/en/destinations/museum-kasbah-of-the-mediterranean-cultures-of-tangier/ "Musee de la Kasbah")with a beautiful sultan garden, a good place for meditation. There is a museum in the Place de la Kasbah, works from 9 to 16 except on Tuesday.

Lovers of antiquity will like the **Museum of Moroccan art and antiques** (Musée des Arts Marocains et des Antiquités). It's right next to the Kasbah, in the same area, in the **palace of the Sultan of Dar El-Makzen**. The palace itself is worthy of attention as a wonderful example of Maghreb culture - with mosaics, Arabian patterns and all sorts of architectural delights. The halls of the palace are as impressive, especially the floors covered with multicolored mosaic, wooden ceilings decorated with oriental carvings and colored murals. Since 1922 the palace works as a museum. The official opening hours are from 8.30 to 18, Monday to Thursday, but there are no guarantees. Sometimes the museum is closed without explanation.

Many ancient maps, engravings and documents and modern Moroccan art.

## **Beaches**

![Seaside of Tangier](/uploads/Tangier12.jpg "Seaside of Tangier")

The city beach extends along the entire city center from the port to the hotel district in **Malabat**. Since it is in the heart of Tangier, it is easily accessible on foot, an excellent area for walking. A lot of nice cafes, a beautiful view of the sea.

But the most beautiful shore is behind the port, on the promenade of **Merkala** (Route de la Plage Mercala), a little further from the center, west of the port. On the one hand, the steep slope of the hill, the remains of the old fortress and the mansions-palaces of the local rich people, on the other - the blue sea. Passionate couples walk here, cyclists chase, and athletes run. Merkala leads to the same small but colorful beach.

Behind the ocean wave you must go all the way to the city - to **Ashakar** (Achakar), about 15 km from Tangier. This is an enormous ocean beach, traditionally wild. Good sand, great waves. At the weekend, there is an overabundance of residents. Across the road there is a kind of food zone, a lot of cafes under the awnings, where you can have a good snack.

## **Caves and pillars of Hercules**

![Caves and pillars of Hercules](/uploads/Tangier13.jpg "Caves and pillars of Hercules")

This is a natural landmark of Morocco, which can be found 18 km from Tangier. In fact, these are two high cliffs, between which lies the Strait of Gibraltar. The way these rock-columns were formed is probably a scientific explanation, but, of course, these natural wonders could not do without a couple of legends. For example, in Greek mythology it is said that these rocks were created by Hercules. Like as, he designated these mountains as the edge of the earth, and these travelers were then guided by seafarers. Hercules took straight and struck a thick mountain in half, the water ran into the rift, and the Gibraltar strait was formed there. And the remaining two rocks on its shores were named Hercules pillars.

The cave is spacious, well lit, clean. It is very beautiful, especially during tides, when caves are filled with clean sea water. On the inner viewing platform, you can enjoy the view of the ocean. If you look closely, the outline of the hole reminds a little of the shape of the African continent. Moreover, archaeologists have thoroughly dug in these caves and even found there some interesting exhibits, for example, ancient tools.

**Tangier is, therefore, the perfect starting point to the country. A city of clear universal identity. The most equidistant place between Morocco and the rest of the world.**
