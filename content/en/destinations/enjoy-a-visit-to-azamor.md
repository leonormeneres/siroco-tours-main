Experience a Moroccan city rich with Portuguese influence in Azamor. Between [Casablanca](/en/destinations/casablanca/ "Casablanca") and [El Jadida](/en/destinations/el-jadida/ "El Jadida"), Azamor is a town situated on the left bank of the Morbeia river. (in Arabic ‘Azemmour’, "the olive tree") is a pleasant stopover on a trip along the Moroccan coast.

Azamor is famous for its incredible history. A trip down the Atlantic coast of Morocco ends up turning that taste of a return to the past. Azamor draws your attention with its houses in lime and earth-colored murals to paint the river.

Azamor is generally identified as the ancient ‘Azama’, a commercial port of the Phoenicians and later of the Roman Empire, which describes the history of Azamor. Even today the remains of a Roman grain deposit in the so-called "Portuguese cisterns" of neighboring El Jadida can be seen.

Some historians believe that Azama was the southernmost city of Morocco at the time of Roman rule, in the time of Augustus. Although dependent on the king of [Fez](/en/destinations/fez/ "Fez"), its fluvial excellence made it to be a very dynamic commercial town. It was so good that he was famous for it. In 1486, due to regional political instability, its inhabitants requested the protection of John II of Portugal(1481-1495), and subsequently became vassals and tributaries. The annual tribute was ten thousand shales(an abundant fish in the river), allowing the establishment of a trading post. As the first factor was the squadron Martim Reinel, who was already there because of the negotiation of the agreement, whose functions he exercised until 1501. This preceded the Portuguese invasion, which would only occur twelve years later.

In terms of heritage, the city retains some reminders of the Portuguese occupation: sections of the walls, houses and inner streets, with Manueline style elements. This is due to King Manuel I of Portugal who in 1508 learned of the great divisions among the inhabitants and the desire of some to become subjects of Portugal. The conquest of the city by the Portuguese people occurred on September 1514.

Despite this, the story reveals that it was not so easy. Also in 1513, the expulsion of some Portuguese living in the city, and consequently closure of the Portuguese factory on the initiative of Muley Zion, gave rise to a new navy on 15 August (500 ships, 13,000 footmen, 2000 on horseback, and seafarers), under the command of D. Jaime, Duke of Bragança. On the following September 1, the Portuguese forces advanced on the city, which surrendered, without resistance, two days later. The military engineer Francisco Danzilho participated in the expedition, which drew one or more views of the city, which were sent to the sovereign.

The stronghold of Azamor was abandoned in 1541, by determination of John III of Portugal (1521-1557), after the fall of the Fortress of Santa Cruz do Cabo de Gué (1541). After this event, other cities followed. Safim was also abandoned, some oothers being Ceuta, Tangier and Mazagão (El Jadida), also Portuguese-speaking. Nowadays, these regions contain very historical forts.

Be prepared to explore the remnants of strong Portuguese history in the region. It is entering a time and culture tunnel, especially if you speak Portuguese, and want to have the taste of listening to your language so far on the Globe. As previously mentioned, the city is situated on the left bank of the Morbeia River, 10km from old Mazagão (El Jadida), and 3km from the mouth of the Oued Oum'er-Rbia. Surrounded by its Portuguese walls, it seems to descend from the top of its cliff like a fantastical engraving of a Doré, a Dulac, or a Robida, prodigious illustration for a fairy tale. Yes, you may believe that even today the old city is surrounded by Portuguese walls. It is also a place of great Moroccan painters and writers.

The Portuguese fortress is inhabited, well preserved, built on the ancient city of Azama. The alleys are labyrinthine, with street stores open to the public. There is a smell of hot bread in bakeries.

You will love the commerce and the culinary(Check also [9 Typical Moroccan Foods](/en/blog/9-typical-moroccan-foods/ "9 Typical Moroccan Foods ")), taking advantage of the naturalness of Azamor. In the middle of the day, melons and watermelons are sold out of stock in overflowing pews. The dates are no less incredible, they are the size of the mouth and slowly they smell like ifta - as the first meal is called, on a day of [fasting](/en/blog/travel-in-morocco-during-ramadan/ "Ramadan"), as soon as the sun goes down.

From the window of the houses, one can see the Arab candies in pyramids and the bees flying around. There are also dry fish and sweaty men, shore workers. What is seen in the alleys of the medina are not watercolors framed in arabesques, but impressions of street art to exalt the regional [crafts](/en/blog/crafts-of-morocco/ "Crafts of Morocco"): the standards of a Moroccan carpet, ceramics to two dimensions.

Azamor is not a mass script. It is exotic, beautiful, historical, calm, tranquil and cultural. To visit it is a curious moment, to cross territory where the walls habituated to hear Portuguese speaking far from home, for those who speak Portuguese, is an incredible experience.
