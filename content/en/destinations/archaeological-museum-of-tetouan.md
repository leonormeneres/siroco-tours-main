Inaugurated on July 19, 1940, the Archaeological Museum of Tetouan is in the city center, a few blocks from the picturesque Medina, declared World Heritage of Humanity in 1997.

The collections of the Archaeological Museum of Tetouan are linked to that of archaeological research in the region.Indeed, most of the remains and objects on display come from excavations undertaken in northern Morocco from the 1930s.

## **Collections**

The museum houses prehistoric artifacts, ancient and Islamic from several sites and monuments of the North, including Kaf Taht L'ghar, M'zora, Lixus, Tamuda or Ksar Es Sghir.

The collections are composed of lithic tools, human remains from prehistory, architectural elements, ceramics, mosaics, coins and bronze statuettes.

The visit to the museum begins with the garden, which houses five mosaics from the 2nd century AD found at Lixus, a collection of Islamic grave markers from the Tetouan cemetery (16th and 17th centuries), or a collection of Roman amphorae.
