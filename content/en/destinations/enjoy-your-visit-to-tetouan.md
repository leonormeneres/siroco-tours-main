Generally, the best times of the year to visit the city will be those that precede and succeed the summer, that is, in April and May and then in September and October. With luck you will get a nice time. November is also a good option, with chances of catching beautiful days to explore the city.

## **History**

Its foundation took place in the late thirteenth century, after the creation by the Marinids (Berber dynasty that reigned in Morocco, in the so-called Kingdom of Fez) of a kasbah and a mosque. The Merínids stood out as great builders, having enlarged Fez, which functioned as capital of the dynasty. Around 1400 the locality was destroyed by the Castilians as a reprisal for the attacks of pirates.

In the late fifteenth century, it was a natural refuge for Muslims fleeing the Iberian Peninsula reconquered by Christians. And then the conflicts began, the newcomers disagreed with the local tribes, and later, with the support of the Rif Mounts, they began to attack the Spanish forts and destroyed the port of Tetouan in 1565.

But the story does not end there. In 1860 the Spaniards temporarily occupied Tétouan. They were expelled again, returned, and later the city became in fact the capital of the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco. All this Spanish involvement left observable marks, such as significant architecture and the Spanish language as an alternative to Arabic among its inhabitants.

The Medina of Tétouan is one of the smallest and one of the most interesting in Morocco.
