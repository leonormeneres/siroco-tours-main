Aït-Ben-Haddou is a fortified city - a ‘ksar’: a set of buildings in clay, wood and straw surrounded by a wall. It is in the region of Souss-Massa-Drâa, Morocco, on the old caravan trade route between the Sahara and [Marrakech](/en/destinations/nightlife-in-marrakech/ "Nightlife in Marrakech"). It’s located on a hill at the foot of the High Atlas, on the banks of the Ounila River, a tributary of Tidili river.

The ksar of Ait-Ben-Haddou is famous among the Moroccan ksour. It was declared a [UNESCO World Heritage Site](/en/blog/unesco-in-morocco/ "UNESCO in Morocco") in 1987.

The city is a perfect example of the regional architecture that precedes the Moroccan Sahara. Most of the city's inhabitants now live in a more modern village on the other side of the river. However, eight families still live in the ksar.

“Ait” means tribe in Tamazight (Berber) while Ben-Haddou is the name of the particular tribe living in this place. Ait Ben-Haddou is one among many tribes, known for their mud and straw houses. The way it was preserved by its inhabitants makes it special and culturally important.

What makes it so special is its beauty associated with preservation, and therefore historical and cultural importance.

You can immerse yourself completely in their way of life when you visit. Here, several famous movies were filmed including ‘Lawrence of Arabia’, ‘The Mummy’, ‘Gladiator’, 'Alexander’, and ‘[Game of Thrones](/en/blog/scenario-of-game-of-thrones-in-morocco/ "Scenario of Game of Thrones in Morocco: a script of surreal beauty ")’.( Want to know what other movies were shot in Morocco?

The village of Ait-Ben-Haddou is about 30km from Ouarzazate. There are shared cabs (grand taxi) that allow you to reach the ksars cheaply. Alternatively, hire a car or go by a private taxi.

## **What is a Ksar?**

![Ait Benhaddou](/uploads/Ait3.jpg "Ait Benhaddou")

The origin of the word, ksar is "small fortified village" but it would eventually lead to the word "castle" in European languages.

Originally built as a community fortress, its purpose was to offer protection from bandits, weather, nomadic enemy tribes and those who wanted to take the land after the harvests. By fortifying the village, the communities were able to secure the oasis and fertile land.

When it was first built, a ksar would have just one main street, opening to the oasis thus allowing direct access for the harvests.

Morocco has many of these communities, almost all cities in the South of Morocco have several of them, located a few kilometers from the main urban center. The cities of Erfoud, Rissani and Zagora are examples. As they were intended for protection and housing, they were not originally very complex structures but turned into real small towns, with shopping streets, mosques and schools.

Each ksar has a different pattern design associated with its creator, which usually follows geometric decorations.

Ait-Ben-Haddou is considered the best preserved ksar of Morocco.

‘Kasbahs’ are houses that have a central garden / courtyard with high towers – not to be confused with ksar.

There are three entrances to the ksar: the main entrance is the most recognizable from photographs - a central gate accessible when crossing the river. The entry fee is between 20 and 30 dirhams.
