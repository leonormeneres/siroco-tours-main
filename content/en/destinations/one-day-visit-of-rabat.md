Rabat is the capital of the Kingdom of Morocco and, together with Fez, Marrakech and Meknes, one of the famous "Imperial cities". The whole place is made up of an incredible junction between its modern business center and its ability to fully preserve the Moroccan flavor and the special atmosphere of the eastern city. Tourists here will be most likely to be struck by the unusual architecture of the city, which is a kind of mixture of Eastern and European traditions. In addition, thanks to the abundance of green spaces, gardens and parks, this amazing city is like a huge reserve, along the spacious avenues which you can wander the whole day.

We recommend starting the day by visiting the Necropolis of Chellah, which was the first human settlement in this region. It is now the ruins of a once rich and beautiful city, overgrown with dense vegetation. The reason for this devastation is that in 1755 a strong earthquake happened in Morocco, which almost erased the complex from the earth.

On the tops of the minarets, trees have already grown, and the storks and other birds have nestled. The amphibians have settled in the magnificent fountains that belong to other times. Everything is surrounded by an imposing wall and a beautiful door that invites to pass. In the interior, a beautiful garden, an allegory of the Muslim "Garden of Paradise": populated with fig trees, orange trees and all kinds of exotic flora.

Then we will go head to the Hassan Tower. It is located on a large esplanade with the Mausoleum of Mohammed V at his feet. The tower was built in the 12th century under Sultan Al-Mansur. The sultan dreamed of building the world's largest mosque so that his entire army could come to prayer. It was planned to build a 90-meter-long minaret, but all plans were never realized. At the time of the death of Sultan Al-Mansur, the altitude was only 44 meters, after which the construction of the mosque stopped. In the following years the building was left to the erosion of time, which was also aided by the earthquake occurred in the eighteenth century.

In the same precinct stands the Mausoleum of Mohammed V , one of the few religious constructions in which the entrance to non-believers is allowed. It began to be erected in 1962 and was completed in 1971. It is a spectacular building with a square floor and two-step roof, with an elegant exterior simplicity that contrasts with the interior sumptuousness of its materials: marble walls, mosaics and gold.

From the city center the Medina of Rabat is separated by Hassan II avenue, passing through a string of structures connecting the past and present of Rabat. Labyrinths of narrow streets can lead you anywhere: to the eastern bazaar, to the Atlantic coast or to the orange walls of the citadel of Kasbah Udayas. All these places will dazzle you, so it’s up to you to choose which path to take first.

It is protected by a powerful wall and has rare features of tranquility and dimensionality, not typical for the eastern markets. The atmosphere of the medina fascinates from all sides where you can see rare and picturesque carpets, ornaments from copper and other handicraft. Many artisans make works of art in front of astonished visitors. Here you will find many cafes, drink freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, enjoy a cup of coffee and taste some delicious food.

If you long to walk around the Old Medina, sooner or later you will feel the salty taste of the ocean, which means you are reaching the Kasbah of the Udayas. It is the fortress, built in the middle of the 12th century, which for many centuries guarded the Moors from barbarian tribes.

It can be accessed by a sandstone door from the Almohad era and, inside the Kasbah, is the garden of the Andalusians, created at the beginning of the 20th century. Also note that an ancient mosque, built in 1150, is located. Here you will find yourself in the embrace of narrow streets with houses in white and blue.

In the afternoon, we can keep discovering the Medina, or go to visit the Royal Palace of Rabat (Dar-al-Makhzen). This is the residence of the king, and, therefore, the center of political life - the Moroccans love their king. Built in the late 19th century, this huge palace complex is decorated with many gardens and fountains. You can get here through an arch with carved gates, where guardsmen will definitely stand.

You can not miss the Archaeological Museum of Rabat if you are interested in history. Here are the testimonials and exhibits of multiple excavations in Morocco. For example, some finds helped to find traces of a unique aterite culture that existed 6,000 years ago.

Or you can visit the Museum of Modern Art Mohammed VI. This is a huge modern three-story museum, where exhibitions of contemporary art are constantly held. Inside the museum, you can relax from the bustle of a big city, enjoying permanent and temporary expositions.

Finally, it’s night, and you arrived at one of the best hours of the day, after all these beautiful sights and stories, covered by the Moroccan atmosphere, you can experience a delicate fusion between high-end European gastronomy and Moroccan cuisine in an irresistible garden restaurant, where peacocks parade through the bougainvillea. It’s the perfect time to soak up and reminisce with a smile.
